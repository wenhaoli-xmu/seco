The marketing expert also presented some graphs showing the market share of different age groups and the preferences of young and old users. The project manager then asked the user interface designer to give a short talk about the technical function design of the remote control. The user interface designer mentioned that the technical function design is to allow the remote control to influence the TV set in a cordless way, by pushing a button on the remote. The user interface designer also mentioned that the dilemma is whether to make a basic remote control with only a few functions or a more multifunctional remote control.

The marketing expert also mentioned that the design of the remote control is very important and that users would buy a good-looking remote control if there is one.
