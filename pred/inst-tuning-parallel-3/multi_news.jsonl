Ms. Ashton's comments about her meeting with Mr. Morsi are the first news of the former president's condition from a source outside the military in nearly a month. His supporters rallied in Cairo on Tuesday night and marched toward the military intelligence headquarters, although no violence had been reported by early Wednesday.

The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

The study takes as its starting point Google's PageRank algorithm, which says that a page is important if a lot of important pages link to it. The study applied PageRank to figures on Wikipedia and found that the most important person in the world comes out as Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist. To get around this issue, the researchers applied a second way of measuring importance: CheiRank. Mix Pagerank and CheiRank together, and you get the final measure: 2DRank. That's how the authors arrived at the top 100 for all 24 editions of Wikipedia – and how Frank Sinatra took pole position. The Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors. The goal is to fix all broken links on the web. Even Sir Isaac Newton recognized that intellectual success depended on what had come before. In an intriguing new study, a team led by University of Tolouse researcher Young-Ho Eom sought to figure out who, exactly, should be considered the most influential thinker in the world. Trawling through 24 different language editions of Wikipedia, Eom's team calculated whose intellectual fingers stretched out the furthest. The result was... somewhat surprising. According to Eom and co., the world's most influential mind was Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. Linneaus beat out everyone, from the Pope to President Obama to Frank Sinatra, Hitler, Caesar—even Jesus. It was Linnaeus' particular scientific penchant, combined with the specifics of Young-Ho Eom's method of searching Wikipedia, says New Scientist, that led to the unexpected result: “Linnaeus topped the chart across all languages because there are so many Wikipedia pages with scientific names in every edition, and they all eventually lead back to him.” This isn't the first time people have tried to figure out the influence of various historical people, of course, and Linnaeus is not a reliable entrant on the list.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The policy has drawn the ire of internet users, who compared it with George Orwell’s dystopian fiction 1984. While voice recognition software almost always transmits data on what users are saying, the combination of sending the data to third-parties and the comparison with Orwell has meant that the Samsung policy has drawn particular attention. The policy states that if users’ spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through their use of Voice Recognition. It makes clear that the tool can be turned off through settings, though that will stop the voice recognition working entirely and Samsung will still continue to collect data about how people use the TV. The policy bears similarities to the telescreens used in 1984, as pointed out by Twitter user and Electronic Frontier Foundation activist Parker Higgins. In that book, Orwell writes that any sound that Winston makes, above the level of a very low whisper, will be picked up by the screen, and that so long as he remains within the field of vision, he can be seen as well as heard. There is no way of knowing whether you are being watched at any given moment. A Samsung statement said that data is encrypted to keep it safe, and that owners can disconnect the TV from wifi if they want to keep their data safe.

In Krystal's 2014 suit against the Jets, she claimed the cheerleaders made only $150 per game and $100 for special event appearances. She also said cheerleaders didn't receive compensation for weekly practices or time spent rehearsing. The cheerleader's attorney, Patricia Pierce, used the rates for games and special events to argue that the actual hourly pay was well below the minimum wage. \"When you look at the actual hours worked versus what Krystal was paid, she only made $3.77 per hour,\" Pierce said. \"When you factor in the required hair, makeup and transportation expenses, the hourly rate goes below $1.50 an hour.\" The Jets cheerleaders, called the Flight Crew, aren't the first to bring a wage suit against an NFL team.

{"pred": "    The news reports that a mysterious disease called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is on the rise again, two years after an outbreak alarmed doctors and parents. The syndrome is still rare, but there have been 50 cases reported across 24 states so far this year, compared to 21 cases in 2015. AFM can be caused by a variety of germs, such as enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. Symptoms include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, or slurred speech. The best prevention is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes. The illness seemed to peak in 2014, with 120 cases reported between August and December. The average age for children stricken with AFM is 7, and many had to be placed on respirators. Although 85% of the children recovered partially, only three have fully recovered. The news also reports on a family whose daughter, Laura, was diagnosed with AFM in 2014. She spent 25 days in the hospital, bedridden and unable to walk. At her worst, she could only move parts of her left arm and left leg. Months of rehabilitation followed, with Laura receiving intensive physical, speech, and occupational therapy. Today, Laura is doing much better and continues to improve. The family is thankful for every little blessing and gain they make. The news concludes by emphasizing the importance of being up to date on vaccinations and practicing good hygiene to prevent viral infections. If a child appears to have a sudden onset of weakness in arms or legs, caregivers should contact a health care provider to have the child assessed for possible neurologic illness. Health care providers are encouraged to report patients meeting the case definition to their state or local health department. Health departments should report patients with illness meeting the case definition to CDC using a brief patient summary form and may contact CDC by email to arrange further laboratory testing.

The investigation into the bloodstain pattern on the cloth was reported Tuesday in the Journal of Forensic Sciences and is apparently the first such analysis of the controversial shroud. Held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, the shroud shows the image of a crucified man and has been analyzed and scrutinized for many, many years. The Vatican regards it as an icon, rather than a religious relic—and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. In 2015, more than 2 million people saw the Shroud of Turin, which is 14-feet-long, 3.5-feet-wide and kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case. The cloth has long been the subject of debate and study. Researchers concluded that the linen seems to be patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse, reports BuzzFeed News, adding evidence to claims that it is a fraud. “This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,” Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, told BuzzFeed News. “Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.” Borrini and his colleagues used real and synthetic blood samples to conduct seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric. By pumping blood onto a model at wound points shown on the shroud, researchers could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction depicted on the linen. They found bloodstains that were inconsistent with any single pose, which seems to suggest a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. 11-MILLION-TON ICEBERG THREATENS TO INUNDATE TINY GREENLAND VILLAGE WITH TSUNAMI If it was truly the death shroud of someone hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, “the bloodstains shouldn’t be so inconsistent.” BuzzFeed reports that researchers found forearm rivulets matched an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, for example, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Wendy Davis, in her memoir due out next week, discloses the most personal of stories preceding her nationally marked fight against tighter abortion restrictions: a decision she and her then-husband made 17 years ago to end a much-wanted pregnancy. The book, “Forgetting to Be Afraid,” goes on sale to the general public Tuesday. Copies will be available Monday at a Fort Worth book signing by Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott. Davis, in a copy of the book obtained by the San Antonio Express-News, wrote that her unborn third daughter had an acute brain abnormality. She said doctors told her the syndrome would cause the baby to suffer and likely was incompatible with life. After getting several medical opinions and feeling the baby they had named Tate Elise “tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her” in the womb, she said the decision was clear. “She was suffering,” Davis wrote. The unborn baby's heart was “quieted” by her doctor, and their baby was gone. She was delivered by cesarean section in spring 1997, the memoir says. Davis wrote that she and her then-husband, Jeff, spent time with Tate the next day and had her baptized. They cried, took photographs and said their good-byes, she wrote, and Tate's lifeless body was taken away the following day. “An indescribable blackness followed. It was a deep, dark despair and grief, a heavy wave that crushed me, that made me wonder if I would ever surface.... And when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person. Changed. Forever changed,” Davis wrote. The 304-page hardcover is priced at $27.97 from Blue Rider Press, and imprint of the Penguin Group.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

Based on its stunningly preserved remains, scientists say the dinosaur’s head and chest seem to have been covered with iridescent feathers akin to those on modern hummingbirds. The flashy display may have provided a social or sexual cue, like modern peacock tails. The dinosaur also has a bird-like body, including the sorts of feathers required for flight, but it has a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor. The ancient animal has been named Caihong juji—Mandarin for “rainbow with the big crest”—the team reports today in the journal Nature Communications. Caihong lived in forests and may have glided from tree to tree, preying on small mammals and lizards, says study co-author Xing Xu, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In life, the duck-size carnivore would’ve weighed roughly a pound.

Exceptional conditions allowed the dinosaur's feathers to fossilize along with its bones. Birds—the last living dinosaurs—use feathers today for flight, but feathers also help birds woo potential mates or jockey for social status. Dinosaur fossils suggest that feathers originally evolved for display, only later taking on the traits needed for flight. Like modern and ancient birds, dinosaurs likely had color vision and took advantage of it with striking, feathery displays. In exceptional cases, scientists can reveal dinosaur feathers’ original colors by finding vestiges of pigment sacs called melanosomes within fossilized plumes. (See the full-body coloration of the feathered dinosaur Anchiornis.) Yang Jan, a local farmer, found the Caihong fossil in northeastern China’s Hebei Province. In February 2014, the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning acquired the fossil from Jan. When scientists led by Dongyu Hu, a paleontologist at China’s Shenyang Normal University, examined the fossil, they found that its well-preserved remnants contained traces of pigment in its feathers. The team sampled 66 sites across the fossil, comparing the melanosomes they saw with melanosomes from modern bird feathers.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called. Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says. Arias says her boss \"scolded\" her for uninstalling the program last year, and fired her soon after.

Speaking under an umbrella in pouring rain, Mr. Cosby’s publicist, Andrew Wyatt, said his client’s defeat was part of the “sex war” happening in Washington, comparing it to accusations of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh that are roiling the capital. Mr. Wyatt said that Mr. Cosby, once a beloved actor and comedian, had endured the “most racist and sexist trial” in the country’s history. On Tuesday, Mr. Cosby, 81, was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, Andrea Constand, at his home outside Philadelphia in 2004. Judge Steven T. O’Neill also ruled that Mr. Cosby qualified as a “sexually violent predator” under state law. Shortly after Bill Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison for sexual assault and taken away in handcuffs, his spokesperson Andrew Wyatt told reporters that Cosby — along with embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh — was the victim of a “sex war.” “What is going on in Washington today with Judge Kavanaugh is part of that sex war that Judge [Steven] O’Neill and his wife are a part of,” Wyatt said, referring to the judge who oversaw Cosby’s trial.

The confrontation began when a teacher and school administrator repeatedly asked her to put away her cellphone during class. Other kids in the class tried to defuse the situation, but the officer was then called to remove the student.

The mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip with photos of Eugene Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying whatever inscription Parker wishes to provide -- his message to the sun. The probe will eventually orbit within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface. The observations and data could provide insight about the physics of stars, change what we know about the mysterious corona, increase understanding of solar wind, and help improve forecasting of major space weather events. Those events can impact satellites and astronauts as well as the Earth -- including the power grid and radiation exposure on airline flights, NASA said. The mission is scheduled to end in June 2025. The solar probe is going to a region of space that has never been explored before, and Parker is looking forward to seeing the science form the mission. He said he is sure that there will be some surprises, as there always are.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

{"pred": "    A lion was shot dead in Kenya on Wednesday after attacking a man, while trackers in South Africa searched for a lion whose escape from a park prompted appeals to wildlife officials to relocate it rather than kill it. The two cases of African lions on the loose highlight the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century because of unregulated hunting, a loss of habitat and growing conflict with livestock herders. Concern about the threatened species intensified last year when an American dentist killed a lion named Cecil in a hunt in Zimbabwe that officials said was illegal. The circumstances of the stray lions also fueled questions about whether to dart a potentially dangerous predator with a tranquilizer and return it to a fenced area, or kill it before it can attack people. Such decisions depend on factors including the training of wildlife experts, their resources and whether the area where a lion is roaming is densely populated. In some cases, local residents have killed lions before officials arrived on the scene. Wildlife officials in Kenya shot the escaped lion several times after it injured a man in the Kajiado district, near Nairobi, the capital, said Paul Udoto, a spokesman for the Kenya Wildlife Service. Officials had planned to capture the lion, but the animal become too agitated by the noise of a gathering crowd and had to be killed, he said. Another senior Kenyan wildlife official, Kitili Mbathi, blamed a faulty electrical fence for the lion's escape from Nairobi National Park. However, a later statement from the Kenya Wildlife Service said the lion was killed in a wildlife migration area outside the park's southern section, which is not fenced, and that the lion was trying to establish new territory. The 13-year-old male lion named Mohawk had recently been involved in territorial fights, according to the statement. The lion struck a 27-year-old man on a motorcycle who was among 400 people surrounding the lion, the wildlife service said. The man suffered deep lacerations on his back as well as bruises from falling off the bike, it said. It was the second incident this month involving a stray lion in Kenya. On March 18, a lion mauled a pedestrian in Nairobi before being captured. Nairobi National Park, which covers 117 square kilometers (45 square miles) on the outskirts of the city, is home to endangered black rhinos, lions, leopards, cheetahs, giraffes and diverse birdlife.

Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\n    News: overposting\n\n    Passage 1: Mike Brown stands for a portrait in front of an artist portrayal of Planet Nine. (Photo by Patrick T. Fallon for The Washington Post) Mike Brown is an astronomer at Caltech who's been instrumental in the discovery of more than 30 dwarf planets and asteroids at the far reaches of our solar system. Most members of the general public probably don't know about all of the planetoids he has found — but many know about the one planet he has killed. When Brown and his team discovered Eris, a dwarf planet more massive than Pluto, it was initially referred to as our solar system's 10th planet. But that ended in 2006 when the International Astronomical Union voted to define \"planet\" officially for the first time. Eris was out of the running, and Pluto was a casualty — cut from the official planetary roll call. Now Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, believe they've compiled the best evidence for a true ninth planet to take Pluto's place in the history books. We called Brown up to chat about the latest blow he has dealt to Pluto fans. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Washington Post: How did you get into the planet finding (and planet killing) business? Mike Brown: So, planetary science is something I got into when I was in grad school. I went into astronomy anticipating studying some of the most distant galaxies, but I fell in love with this field because planetary science is just so much more concrete to me. I could actually go outside at night and see this thing I was studying. And the reason why I particularly like these objects I study in the outer solar system is that they have grand importance for how our solar system came together, and how our planetary system formed, but it's also just as much about this journey of discovery. It's exploration. For me, this is what we do as humans. We see our neighborhood out there and explore it. WP: Tell us more about that \"grand importance.\" What can objects like Eris, Pluto and Planet Nine teach us about the origins of the solar system? MB: The objects in the outer solar system have the unique property of not having been messed with very much. All the planets on the inside of the solar system have been heated, smashed, had their orbits pushed around, and so on. But on the very edge, there's", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd. While the dwarf planet tries to fight its way back into the good graces of Those Who Deem What Counts as a Planet, another icy orb even further out may snatch that designation first. Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says. Not everyone's convinced. \"I have seen many, many such claims in my career,\" a planetary scientist at Colorado's Southwest Research Institute tells Nature. \"And all of them have been wrong.\" (The Washington Post caught up with Brown for a Q&A on the latest Pluto-killing endeavor.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4933}

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

The storm caused massive flooding, destroyed homes and businesses, and left thousands of people homeless and displaced. The response to the storm was slow and inadequate, and many people were left to fend for themselves in the aftermath. The federal government and local authorities were criticized for their response to the storm, and many people were left without adequate housing, food, and medical care. The storm also had a significant impact on the economy, with businesses and industries suffering significant losses. The recovery from Hurricane Katrina was a long and difficult process, and it took years for the region to fully recover. The storm highlighted the need for better disaster preparedness and response, and it led to significant changes in the way the federal government and local authorities respond to natural disasters.

That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf. But our local expertise said otherwise.

The lawmaker told CNN Tuesday it was unclear when the movement was detected, what the direction of the projectile was and how it was being transported. He attended the briefing by South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) in Seoul on Monday. All eyes have been on North Korea following the country's sixth test of a nuclear weapon Sunday. Seismological data indicated the weapon was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation, nuclear experts said. North Korean state media claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear weapon, which could be fitted atop a long-range missile capable of striking the United States. Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM. The country has test-fired a number of missiles this summer, including two long-range ones in July and an intermediate-range one in August that overflew the Japanese island of Hokkaido. A South Korean lawmaker who attended the briefing said the NIS said North Korea may test-fire an ICBM towards the North Pacific at a lower angle than the two tests in July, which were lofted, meaning they flew higher but not as far. The South Korean Navy announced Tuesday it conducted live-fire drills off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula to check its \"immediate operational readiness\" after the country's Air Force and Army conducted their own joint drills. South Korea's Navy conducted a live-fire drill in the waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korea's Sunday nuclear test. \"Wherever it is, whether on or under water, if North Korea provokes, we will immediately destroy and bury them at sea,\" the Navy said in a statement. While South Korean forces have flexed their muscles, diplomats in New York gathered at the United Nations and condemned the nuclear test. Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday the United States would circulate a resolution in response after urging her colleagues to adopt the strongest sanctions measures possible to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program. \"Enough is enough,\" Haley said. \"North Korea has basically slapped everyone in the face in the international community that has asked them to stop.\" Another lawmaker who attended the Monday briefing, Lee Cheol-woo, told reporters the NIS informed them that Pyongyang had dug extra tunnels", "answers": ["Following North Korea's most powerful weapons test yet on Sunday, a South Korean lawmaker tells CNN his country's intelligence service believes the North has an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on the move. Things get pretty vague beyond that: He didn't know the method of transport or when the movement was noticed. But Reuters does pick up some alleged details on those fronts, via an unnamed source quoted by South Korea’s Asia Business Daily. Its source says the ICBM started moving Monday, is only being moved at night, and is headed toward the nation's west coast. Reuters notes there's some likelihood that another test could come on or around Saturday: Sept. 9 is the country's founding day holiday. CNBC notes North Korea conducted a nuke test on Sept. 9, 2016. Two more details that allegedly came from the South's National Intelligence Service briefing: word that additional tunnels have been dug out at the North's nuclear test site that would facilitate future detonations, and suspicions that the next ICBM test firing might be directed toward the North Pacific but aimed at a lower angle, which would in theory allow it to fly further than previous tests, which had more of an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the White House tells Reuters it has given \"in-principle approval\" to a request by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to abolish a limit regarding warhead weights, a move that would strengthen the power with which it could attack the North, if necessary.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The news reports that colon cancer rates are rising among men and women under 50, the age at which guidelines recommend screenings start. One in seven colon cancer patients is under 50. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively. Doctors should be on the lookout for warning signs of colon cancer, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a blockage in the colon. People with a family history of colon cancer and others who are at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "    Humans arrived in the arid interior of Australia some 10,000 years earlier than we thought, archaeologists suggest, with the discovery of ancient artefacts in a South Australian cave that have been dated to as far back as 49,000 years ago. The site, which is a newly discovered cave in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, is known as the Warratyi rock-shelter. Archaeologist Giles Hamm from La Trobe University in Melbourne led the excavations at the cave, finding what appear to be some of the oldest bone and quartz tools ever found in Australia, plus the earliest known use of the pigment ochre in the country’s history. Artefacts that have been found so far include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre and gypsum pigments, and the team says this is evidence that these early technologies were developed locally. The old idea is that people might have come from the East, from the Levant, out of Africa, and these modern humans may have come with a package of innovative technologies. But the development of these fine stone tools, the bone technology, we think that happened as a local innovation, due to a local cultural evolution. That’s significant, adds one of the team, Gavin Prideaux from Flinders University in Adelaide, because it challenges certain assumptions that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in on the globe. There is a Eurocentric view that material culture in Australia is quite simplistic and backward, but this helps rewrite that story. Until now, the oldest human tool found in Australia’s vast, arid interior has been a tiny axe fragment found earlier this year in the Carpenter's Gap rock-shelter of the Kimberley region of northwest Australia. While the Carpenter’s Gap site is not far from the northwest coast of Australia - thought to be one of the earliest settled parts of Australia - the Warratyi rock-shelter sits more than 2,000 km from the early settlement of Lake Mungo in southeasten New South Wales, making it a much more difficult trek. The tools have been dated based on a couple of estimates - quartz grains from the site have been dated to 44,000 years ago, but radiocarbon dating of the burnt eggshells, which are thought to be evidence of human cooking, revealed them to be between 45,000 and 49,000 years old. The shells are thought to have come from emus and a large, extinct flightless", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News. Hamm was surveying a section of Australia's Flinders Ranges when his partner, aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard, had to go to the bathroom. \"Nature called and Cliff walked up this creek bed into this gorge and found this amazing spring surrounded by rock art,\" Hamm says. At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Pop star Britney Spears recently ended a radio blitz promoting her Las Vegas residency, which starts in December, and her handlers are leaving nothing to chance. They are informing radio stations that they should only discuss Britney's Vegas show, her new single and her \"Britney Jean\" album. Radio insiders say efforts to limit Spears' opportunities to embarrass herself are doing the complete opposite, even when interviewers stick to the \"assigned parameters.\" Deejays Roula and Ryan from Houston's 104.1 KRBE recently had their taped segment pulled when it turned out to be an absolute disaster. Spears' reps argue the info they provided was not a mandate, but rather an aid to make the radio spots move along smoothly. Oops, Spears did it again on a Houston Hot 95.7 phoner. Even when the hosts lavished praise on her music, tour and perfume, a detached-sounding Spears needed to be asked twice if she had a fragrance. Spears has since denied that she'll lip-sync in Vegas. On Tuesday, before-and-after images emerged from Hoax Films, a visual-effects studio, of the 31-year-old mother of two's \"Work Bitch\" video. They suggest that a chubby Spears did the filming, but a digitally slimmed-down version appears in the final edit. Team Britney didn't comment on the video.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

In the NICU, they used to call her Miss Sassy because of her ability to express her displeasure with her circumstances. Oakleigh had grown normally and her health was excellent up until a couple of months ago when she came down with a sudden fever. Out of nowhere, her fever spiked to 104. It just so happened that Oakleigh had a severe UTI that probably had invaded her kidneys. After going on antibiotics, the fever went away but returned a week later. She has battled with reoccurring infections over the latest months and was then hospitalized for further testing. The tests revealed that Oakleigh has stage 3 kidney reflux. This is rather common with this condition, but the bacteria associated with her infection was a dangerous, antibiotic resistant strain of Pseudomonas. While she was in the hospital, tests were done on her heart which revealed moderate ASD and pulmonary stenosis. This is especially concerning when you consider the infection and the involvement of the kidneys. Oakleigh is currently scheduled for surgery at the end of this month. They will be operating to fix the reflux in her left kidney, which now has 22% functionality, in hopes to eliminate future infections. This will be about a 4 ½ hour procedure. Her left kidney is actually 2 kidneys, with 2 different ureters which will have to be cut back to a length that will prevent reflux. She will also have to have a pocket on the outside of the kidney removed. The next step after healing from the surgery is to meet with the cardiologist to discuss additional testing for her heart condition.

{"pred": "    The news is about the discovery of stone tools in Kenya. The tools are from the Middle Stone Age and are the oldest of their kind. They are smaller, more specialized, and made from obsidian that came from far away. The researchers think that long periods of stress from repeated earthquakes and cycles of drought and heavy rains may have pushed these early humans to partner up with neighboring communities to come up with ways to cope. The tools are evidence of advanced thinking and planning, and the exchange of raw materials is a tell-tale sign of exchange between different groups of people. The researchers also find evidence of exchange of brightly colored red and black rocks that were then drilled into, possibly to extract pigment. This is the earliest evidence of the extraction of pigments. The news suggests that the evolution of some of these behaviors occurred much earlier than we thought in the African stone age. The role of climate change is highlighted, and the researchers argue that hominin populations did not disappear - so at least some of them must have adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering and sharing, and innovation. The new discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin are exciting because they show that one or more hominin groups were doing seemingly \"modern\" things at this critical time period. The tools are evidence of expanded social networks, transmission of information and technological innovation.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

In a rare sit-down interview, for broadcast on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, Trump told Chuck Todd: “I have to say, no matter what you do, you’re gonna have problems. Because you have sick people. They happen to be intelligent. And, you know, they can be sick as hell and they’re geniuses in a certain way. They are going to be able to break the system.” The New York real-estate billionaire, who boasts of possessing a concealed carry permit, said he did not see the need for increased firearms regulations after the mass shooting in Oregon. He amplified the argument in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week, saying: “The gun laws have nothing to do with this. This is mental illness.” At a rally in suburban Nashville on Saturday, Trump mentioned his New York state handgun carry permit and added that anyone who attacked him would be “shocked”, because he would emulate Charles Bronson in the vigilante film Death Wish. “I’m a very, very big second amendment person,” Trump said in Tennessee. “This is about self-defense, plain and simple.” Trump reminisced about the Bronson-starring 1974 film and got people in the crowd to shout out the title in unison. In the movie, an affluent, liberal architect embarks on a vigilante mission after his wife is killed and his daughter raped. “Today you can’t make that movie because it’s not politically correct,” Trump said. Speaking to NBC, Trump said those US jurisdictions with “the strongest, the most stringent laws [on gun control] are in almost every case the worst places. It doesn’t seem to work.” Instead, at both rally and in the interview, as on the day of the shooting, the Republican frontrunner blamed mental illness for such shootings as that at Umpqua Community College. Trump also defended his newly introduced tax plan, which independent economists estimate will cost $12tn over 10 years, by noting his ability to cut costs. He pointed to transportation as one place where he could save money. “I look at the cost of a road where they’re gonna spend $600m building a simple road,” said Trump. “And I don’t mean I’m gonna save you a little bit.

The new boarding process has been in the works for months and has been tested in a handful of test gates in Chicago and Houston. Moving forward, the airline will still have five boarding groups but will only use two lanes for boarding. Elite and other priority passengers in group 1 and 2 will load through lane 1, while customers in group 3, 4 and 5 will use lane 2. Those not actively boarding will be asked to remain seated until paged. Chase co-branded credit card holders will board in group 2. In addition to the new boarding process, United is also launching push notifications for those who have the airline's mobile app. This week's updates come as the latest milestone in a long history of experimentation that United and other airlines have performed around the boarding process. Some of United's peers are already using this simplified process. American Airlines currently boards by zone using only two lanes while Delta Air Lines splits the difference and boards with four. One difference between United and its competitors is that top tier or \"1K\" elite members will be able to pre-board before the official process starts. New boarding lanes and gateside notifications should roll out to airports this week.

Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up.

He is accused of participating in a village massacre in 1943 in what is now known as Belarus. The Russian Embassy in Ottawa ripped into the federal government after news emerged that Katriuk had died. The Russian Embassy said that Katriuk's death makes it impossible for him to face justice. The Canadian government ignored numerous appeals by Canadian Jewish organizations and efforts by the Russian authorities to ensure that justice be served, allowing Katriuk to retain citizenship of Canada while peacefully residing in this country. Russia's intervention in Ukraine has led to Canada all but severing relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as imposing a slew of sanctions against individuals and entities in both countries. The Federal Court ruled in 1999 that Katriuk lied about his voluntary service for German authorities during the war in order to obtain Canadian citizenship. The court concluded Katriuk had been a member of a Ukrainian battalion implicated in numerous atrocities in Ukraine -- including the deaths of thousands of Jews in Byelorussia between 1941 and 1944. But in 2007 the Canadian government overturned an earlier decision to revoke Katriuk's citizenship, due to a lack of evidence. A study three years ago alleged Katriuk was a key participant in a massacre in Khatyn during the Second World War. The article said a man with Katriuk's name lay in wait in March 1943 outside a barn that had been set ablaze, operating a machine-gun and firing on civilians as they tried to flee the burning building.

News of Katriuk's death emerged just several hours after the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs said Ottawa should take the necessary steps to ensure he be held accountable if he were found guilty of war crimes committed in collaboration with the Nazis.

He died on Friday at age 94. His wife of more than 70 years, Barbara, died at the age of 92 earlier this year. Mr. Bush was the last American president to serve in World War II, a fight that helped shape his life and the lives of many in his generation. He went on to build a sterling resume—businessman, member of Congress, envoy to the United Nations and China, head of the Central Intelligence Agency—before becoming Republican Ronald Reagan’s vice president in 1980 and then succeeding him in the White House in the election in 1988. He lost his bid for re-election to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, after a campaign in which he was hampered by two years of disappointing economic performance and an insurrection among his own party’s conservatives over a decision to raise taxes. The loss was a bitter personal disappointment, but one he handled with the kind of grace that allowed him to become friends with Mr. Clinton in later life. In subsequent years, historians have been far kinder regarding the Bush presidency than were voters at the time. Mr. Bush also won some degree of vindication when his eldest son, George W.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR After several hours of debate legislators in the lower house on Tuesday gave final passage to drug law amendments that make possession of up to 2oz (56.6g) of marijuana a petty offence that would not result in a criminal record. Cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises would be permitted in Jamaica, where the drug has long been culturally entrenched but illegal. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The law paves the way for a licensing authority to be set up to deal with regulations on cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific and therapeutic purposes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Rastafarians can also legally use marijuana for religious purposes for the first time on the island where the spiritual movement was founded in the 1930s. Tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad will be able to apply for permits at a cost authorising them to legally buy small amounts of \"ganja\", as it is known locally. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Peter Bunting, the island's national security minister, said the Jamaican government did not plan to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR For decades debate has raged in Jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting ganja. Previous efforts to decriminalise small amounts have been scuttled because officials feared they would violate international treaties and bring sanctions from Washington.

A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports.

The city, holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, was last struck by a Palestinian rocket in 1970, and it was not a target when Saddam Hussein's Iraq fired missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a four-hour strategy session with a clutch of senior ministers in Tel Aviv on widening the military campaign, while other cabinet members were polled by telephone on raising the mobilization level. Political sources said they decided to more than double the current reserve troop quota set for the Gaza offensive to 75,000. The move did not necessarily mean all would be called into service. Hours earlier, Egypt's prime minister, denouncing what he described as Israeli aggression, visited Gaza and said Cairo was prepared to mediate a truce. Officials in Gaza said 29 Palestinians - 13 militants and 16 civilians, among them eight children and a pregnant woman - had been killed in the enclave since Israel began its air strikes. Three Israeli civilians were killed by a rocket on Thursday. The Israeli military said 97 rockets fired from Gaza hit Israel on Friday and 99 more were intercepted by its Iron Dome anti-missile system. Dozens of Israeli bombing raids rocked the enclave, and one flattened the Gaza Interior Ministry building. In a further sign Netanyahu might be clearing the way for a ground operation, Israel's armed forces announced that a highway leading to the territory and two roads bordering the enclave of 1.7 million Palestinians would be off-limits to civilian traffic.

Israel had offered to hold its offensive to accommodate a visit from Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, provided Hamas held its fire as well. But Hamas said it would keep firing, and one Israeli defense minister complained that 50 rockets had flown in from Gaza during Kandil's visit, CNN reports. A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times. Israel has now hit 250 Gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes CNN—between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said. Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible. That time is far bygone.\" For its part, the Obama administration says it's seeking help from Arab countries in calling on Hamas to relent. \"The onus rests squarely on Hamas ... to stop its rocket attacks,\" says a State Department spokesman.

{"pred": "        The news is that an ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold. The ocean was a mile deep in places and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water. The view of the planet's ancient history radically re-writes what many scientists believed only a decade ago. Back then, flowing water was widely considered to have been a more erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only rarely, and never forming long-standing seas and oceans. The scientists used the Keck II telescope and NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, both in Hawaii, and the ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile, to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked specifically at how different forms of water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons. The infrared maps show that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium. The high concentration means that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137m. But Mars was probably never completely submerged. Based on the Martian terrain today, the scientists believe the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface. The Atlantic, by comparison, covers about 17% of Earth's surface. The huge body of water lasted for millions of years. But over time, the Martian atmosphere thinned. The drop in pressure meant more ocean water wafted into space. The planet lost much of its insulation too. No longer warm enough to keep the water liquid, the ocean receded and eventually froze. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up the Martian polar caps. Nasa's Curiosity rover has already shown that Mars had standing water for 1.5 billion years, longer than it took for life to emerge on Earth. Now we see that Mars must have been wet for a period even longer. John Bridges, a planetary scientist at Leicester University, who works on NASA's Curiosity rover mission, said Mars was surely at least habitable in the distant past. The search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its Exomars rover to the red planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The research examines the evolution of a specialized way birds emit sound — closed-mouth vocalization. The study emerges from a new collaboration, funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, to understand the origin and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds and the large array of sounds it can produce. Because birds descended from dinosaurs, the research may also shed light on how dinosaurs made sound.

Though the Jurassic job was fun, Rydstrom remembers it as a tall order: He had to create dozens of distinct dinosaur noises essentially from scratch, since no one really knows what these long-dead animals would have sounded like. His solution was to spend months recording animal noises — some exotic, some not — then tweaking those homegrown sounds to create something otherworldly but still organic.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

His lawyers argued that the trial should have been held outside of Boston because of the widespread outrage over the attack and that he deserves a new trial elsewhere. They also argued that a recent Supreme Court ruling about the vagueness of the definition of a \"crime of violence\" throws many convictions into question. The legal term \"crime of violence\" was applied to Tsarnaev's actions. Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 federal charges in the bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260. He apologized at his sentencing. Attorneys for Tsarnaev appealed his conviction and death sentence, arguing that publicity made it impossible for him to get a fair trial in Boston and that capital punishment is unconstitutional. They cited a recent dissent by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer in which he said that he believes the death penalty \"now likely constitutes a legally prohibited 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\" However, the majority opinion in that very same case opened with the declaration that \"capital punishment is constitutional.\" Tsarnaev was sentenced to death in June for helping his older brother carry out the April 15, 2013, blasts that killed three people and injured and maimed more than 200 others. The appeal claims that \"continuous and unrelenting publicity\" about the bombings, the defendant and his family, and wrenching survivor stories prevented him from getting an impartial hearing. It notes that Boston announced a new holiday marking the bombings while jurors were deliberating Tsarnaev's guilt.

Warning: Contains spoilers for Game of Thrones Season 6. \"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.\" Except for one very lucky actor who's done both, just in separate roles. Dean-Charles Chapman is currently known on Game of Thrones for playing King Tommen Baratheon, first of his name and however it goes, who took the throne in Season 4 after his brother Joffrey's death. But Chapman has only played Tommen since 2014, because the character was recast from the much younger actor, Callum Wharry. But oddly, Chapman was in the show before then, by the name of a tiny lordling named Martyn Lannister. Hello Giggles first caught the similarities, noticing that the the king who's \"only half-Lannister\" looks exactly like his pure-blooded Lannister cousin (and also, IMDb says so). For reference, that's Tommen on the left and Martyn on the right: It's an easy thing to miss because poor Martyn Lannister only appeared for two episodes in the third season before getting the axe. For those who remember way back when Robb Stark had an army and was alive, Martyn and Willem Lannister were taken as hostages by Robb's army. But in a fit of vengeance, they were murdered by a northern lord named Rickard Karstark. Robb, channeling his inner Ned, was furious over the murdered children and beheaded Karstark himself. Karstark's son is still bitter toward Starks in Season 6, and now works for Ramsay Bolton. While this likely has no effect on the greater story, it does feed directly into the never-discussed \"Tommen is a faceless man\" theory. That is probably nonsense, but that's never stopped Game of Thrones theories before. Guys, we may not be able to predict what happens in future episodes of Game of Thrones, but we should all be aware of what’s happened in past episodes, right?

The vote to release the memo comes after committee Republicans, led by chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, a California Republican, pushed for its disclosure. The memo has been a source of escalating partisan tension in Congress. Republicans argue it shows wrongdoing by FBI officials involved in surveillance of a Trump campaign aide, while Democrats say it mischaracterizes intelligence and is an attempt to distract from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PS4 lead system architect Mark Cerny talked about how the evolution of the PS4 came about, saying it began five years ago, earlier on in the life of the PS3.

{"pred": "    The new Facebook is invasive, and computer scientists are now one step closer to reading our minds. Researchers from UC Berkeley pieced together the brain patterns of its subjects as they watched YouTube videos, and then produced a YouTube video of their own with the results. The video is a blurry, dream-like interpretation of reality. For the experiment, subjects spent hours lying still inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine, watching two sets of movie trailers. The MRI machine recorded the amount of blood flowing through the visual cortex, the part of the brain that processes visual information. During the first set, recorded brain activity was fed into a computer to program a \"movie reconstruction algorithm,\" which matched neural activity to what was taking place in the video. The algorithm thus learned to associate certain neural patterns with dynamic information - shapes, images, sounds - against 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos. Subjects then watched the same set of trailers as the algorithm pieced together a video based on brain activity recorded by the MRI. The result is a continuous, if abstract, reconstruction of the actual videos. The key word there is \"continuous.\" Scientists have long been able to reconstruct static photos and images from reading brain patterns, but this is believed to be a first for reading a dynamic visual experience. It's only a small step towards Jedi mind reading, but the scientists say it paves the way for eventually being able to see what's going on in the mind without visual stimulation: dreams and thoughts.

Gallant's coauthors acted as study subjects, watching YouTube videos inside a magnetic resonance imaging machine for several hours at a time. The team then used the brain imaging data to develop a computer model that matched features of the videos - like colors, shapes and movements - with patterns of brain activity. Once we had this model built, we could read brain activity for that subject and run it backwards through the model to try to uncover what the viewer saw.

Statistical tools can’t answer those questions any more definitively than Malaysian officials have. Yet they can help refine and focus the hunt for the plane and for a solution to the deepening mystery of its March 8 disappearance. Bayesian statisticians are particularly helpful in a search operation. Their methods allow hunters to update their estimates of the probability of finding their target in any latitude-longitude combination — or even in three dimensions, accounting for depth in the water. Bayesians helped hunt U-boats in World War II, a U.S. submarine in the 1960s and an Air France jet in 2011. There’s a fourth dimension to the current search: the cause of the disappearance. New developments, such as information about how the plane’s communication systems were shut off, have lowered the probability that the plane disappeared because of an accident and increased the likelihood of deliberate diversion. Which explanation is the current leader, in turn, affects the probability of finding the plane at any given location: A deliberate act has made spots farther from the takeoff point of Kuala Lumpur more likely. Bayesian inference formalizes what will seem, to many unfamiliar with it, like common sense. Its founding principle is that most new situations can be assessed and assigned probabilities: How likely is this restaurant to be good? How likely is this cough to be a cold? How likely is Duke to win the NCAA title? Our first estimate of these probabilities may be no better than an educated guess. For example, we know that 60 percent of our restaurant meals in town have been good, or that Duke has won titles in four of the last 25 seasons (16 percent). Then we start layering new information. The restaurant is full. Now we can feel more confident in our choice: All of our good meals in town have been in full restaurants, but just half of our bad meals have been. What is the chance of a good meal, given that a restaurant is full? It’s 75 percent, based on this new information, since 75 percent of meals in full restaurants have been good.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time.

Durst's attorneys cited his advanced age and poor health in their request for him to be housed at FCI Terminal Island, a federal prison with medical facilities near Los Angeles.

The judge ruled that there were no instances of deliberate misstatements and reckless disregard of the truth in the affidavit supporting the search warrant, although the dog's findings may have had inconsistencies, there were other arguments in the six-page affidavit that could constitute probable cause.

{"pred": "    Robin Williams, who died unexpectedly today at 63, was hugely admired among his own generation -- the genuine affection in the room, say, when he won his \"Good Will Hunting\" Oscar speaks to just how well-liked he was in Hollywood. And yet unlike many of his contemporaries, Williams had a particular impact on the slice of the population now in our mid-to-late 20s and early 30s. Through the 1990s, Williams, an established film star, shifted into a new gear in his career; he generously and humbly took on entertainment for kids. Williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns, but for people my age, Williams was our childhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams' filmography in the 1980s and early 1990s is full of prestige projects (\"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"Awakenings,\" \"Dead Poets Society\"), but something shifted with \"Hook\"; the movie about Peter Pan rediscovering the joy of Neverland had the same effect, perhaps, on Williams, who'd always been wacky and loose on-screen but was suddenly acting like he'd never grown up. It took a fairly humble A-lister to play a supporting role in an animated film at a time when voice acting was an anonymous profession, and a fairly brave comic known for working blue to abandon anything that wasn't safe for young children. And yet Williams' performance as the Genie in \"Aladdin\" was straightforwardly a triumph, lending one of Disney's grimmer stories its imaginative expansiveness. Without Williams, it's impossible to imagine \"Aladdin\" becoming the VHS classic it was through the 1990s; people in my age bracket, even those who may not be able to quote chapter and verse, can easily call to mind the sense of fun and comfort Williams' voice conjured. He was generous enough to erase his recognizable face and body entirely, and yet as a blue drawing was more vivid and lifelike than the vast majority of TV characters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Again and again, Williams went to extremes in his desire to please. In \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" simply one of the best family films ever made, the actor buried his face under makeup and his body in a fat suit in order to pull off physical comedy that felt, for kids, somehow illicit. We weren't supposed to be seeing something so strangely charged, even if the moral (about parental love) was brought home safely.", "answers": ["After Robin Williams' sudden death, the tributes are rolling in, with many recalling a comic genius grappling with private challenges.

Much of it will be some of the same adjectives used when any great performer dies—especially before their time. But in Williams' case, most of it will be true.\" Early in his career, \"it was clear that Mr. Williams was one of the most explosively, exhaustingly, prodigiously verbal comedians who ever lived,\" AO Scott writes in the New York Times. And beyond that, \"his essential persona as an entertainer combined neediness and generosity, intelligence and kindness, in ways that were charming and often unexpectedly moving.\" Williams may have gotten his start long before Aladdin, but he gave a \"generous and humble\" gift to the millennial generation, writes Daniel D'Addario at Salon. \"Williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns, but for people my age, Williams was our childhood,\" from Mrs. Doubtfire to Jumanji to Flubber. In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan recalls a moment when, facing an onslaught of photographers, Williams asked him—in the voice of a fly from a 1950s sci-fi flick—to \"help me, Ken.

Toronto police did not officially confirm until late Sunday that the bodies discovered at 50 Old Colony Rd. in the city's north end on Friday were those of Mr. Sherman, 75, the founder of generic pharmaceuticals giant Apotex Inc., and his 70-year-old wife, Honey, a gregarious philanthropist whose causes ranged from higher education to health care to the Jewish community. A Toronto police source told The Globe and Mail that a real estate agent who had been helping to sell the Shermans' North York home – it was recently listed for $6.9-million – discovered the bodies on Friday morning. There was no sign of forced entry to the home and no note left behind to explain what had happened, the police source said. As tributes and condolences poured in over the weekend – including from Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Toronto Mayor John Tory – friends of the Shermans in Toronto's tight-knit Jewish community struggled to find an explanation for their deaths. Honey and Barry Sherman were proof that opposites attract, according to people who knew the couple. Ms. Sherman was warm, genuine and loved to socialize. Mr. Sherman was a renowned workaholic, not comfortable with small talk and occasionally let on that he would rather go to the dentist than attend another fundraiser. But he always showed up because it was important to his wife. Mr. Sherman talked business with a handful of friends at a reception in Toronto a few weeks ago for federal Conservative", "answers": ["The investigation into the mysterious deaths of a billionaire and his wife is now being led by homicide detectives, police say—suggesting the deaths of Barry and Honey Sherman were either murder-suicide or a double murder. Police, who have described the deaths as \"suspicious,\" revealed Sunday that the cause of death for both Shermans was \"ligature neck compression,\" a form of strangulation, the CBC reports. Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later. The couple also sent out invitations last week to a dinner party at their winter home in Palm Beach."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2360}
