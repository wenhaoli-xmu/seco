The previous versions of ELMo were trained on a one billion word large English corpus, while these versions of ELMo were trained on much larger corpora, ranging from 20 million to 280 million tokens. The larger training sets allow the models to capture more semantic and contextual information, resulting in better quality embeddings.

The model takes as input a sequence of tokens, each of which comprises a word token, a character sequence, and an image, in their respective representation. At each decoding step, representations from each modality are combined via the modality attention module to produce an entity label for each token. The modality attention module learns a unified representation space for multiple available modalities (words, characters, images, etc.), and produces a single vector representation with aggregated knowledge among multiple modalities, based on their weighted importance.

They also analyze the NLP jobs submitted to a commercial centralized GPU cluster and find that about 87.5% NLP related jobs belong to a few common tasks, suggesting that more than 90% of the networks were composed of several common components. These observations motivate the development of NeuronBlocks, a DNN toolkit for NLP tasks that aims to reduce the development cost and increase productivity.
