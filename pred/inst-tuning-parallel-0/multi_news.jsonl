We are expecting people to pack up and leave,\" said Mark McDonald, spokesman for Mayor Nutter. \"I'm not going to speculate about what the city might do at any time down the road from now.\" For about 90 minutes, protesters chanted slogans such as, \"What does democracy look like?

The inventor of the Kalashnikov assault rifle apparently wrote to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church before he died expressing fears he was morally responsible for the people it killed. Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died last month aged 94, wrote a long emotional letter to Patriarch Kirill in May 2012, church officials say. He said he was suffering \"spiritual pain\" over the many deaths it caused. Kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for those killed. The letter published by Izvestia provides a fascinating insight into the mind of the man who created Russia's most famous weapon. Mikhail Kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles. More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide. The gun brought Kalashnikov fame and a string of awards. But his letter to the Patriarch suggests that, towards the end of his life, Kalashnikov felt a degree of guilt - or \"spiritual pain\" as he puts it - for having invented a killing machine. It's unclear, though, how much of this he wrote himself. Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. The letter is typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, and is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov\". The Kalashnikov, or AK-47, is one of the world's most familiar and widely used weapons. Its comparative simplicity made it cheap to manufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain. It is thought that more than 100 million Kalashnikov rifles have been sold worldwide. Kalashnikov refused to accept responsibility for the many people killed by his weapon, blaming the policies of other countries that acquired it. However, pride in his invention was tempered with sadness at its use by criminals and child soldiers. \"It is painful for me to see when criminal elements of all kinds fire from my weapon,\" Kalashnikov said in 2008. He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia Cyril Alexander Volkov, Press secretary for Russian Patriarch Kirill Defend his country In his letter to Patri", "answers": ["In our own obituary of AK-47 inventor Mikhail Kalashnikov last month, we included this quote: The rifle was invented \"for the protection of the Motherland,\" he said. \"I have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it.\" It turns out \"no regrets\" might not have exactly been true. The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

Catherine Ashton, the EU's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, had an in-depth conversation during her two-hour meeting with Mr. Morsi at an undisclosed location. Ms. Ashton's comments about her meeting with Mr. Morsi are the first news of the former president's condition from a source outside the military in nearly a month. His supporters rallied in Cairo on Tuesday night and marched toward the military intelligence headquarters, although no violence had been reported by early Wednesday. Ashton met with a wide range of Egyptian political figures, including Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, the commander of the armed forces; liberal activists and politicians who supported the coup; and a hard-line Islamist party that backed Morsi's removal but has since wavered in its support for the military. She also met with representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood. Ashton said she hoped the meetings would facilitate conversations that might lead to a political solution. But she stressed that Egyptians, and particularly those in power, must ensure that the country moves forward along a democratic path. The people of Egypt will determine their own future. Although Ashton has sometimes struggled during her E.U. tenure to publicly articulate a unified message on behalf of the bloc's 28 member nations, she is known as a charming envoy behind closed doors. She has previously been involved in tough international negotiations over Iran's nuclear program and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In Cairo on Tuesday, her reticence about the substance of her conversation with Morsi appeared at least partly intended to help jump-start discussions between the interim government and the ousted Brotherhood-backed leaders. Officials from the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, from which Morsi hails, told Ashton that any political solution for Egypt must be based on \"the return of the president.\" The statement said the demonstrations in support of Morsi would not stop until \"constitutional legitimacy\" was restored. His backers have used that phrase to refer to returning him to power, as well as to reinstating the country's Islamist-dominated parliament and the constitution ratified under Morsi through a popular referendum.

The man, Jack McCullough, was serving a life sentence for the 1957 murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. McCullough was freed shortly after the hearing and was whisked away in a car driven by a family member. After the judge's ruling, McCullough turned toward his stepdaughter, Janey O'Connor, and flashed her a private signal that she says means \"I love you.\" She was seated behind him and broke into tears but managed a big smile back. Maria Ridulph's murder went unsolved for half a century. Then detectives pursued a tip, and a man was brought to trial and convicted in the 1957 murder of the 7-year-old in Sycamore, Illinois. Now that man is free. Ann O'Neill's 2013 series on the case, \"Taken,\" raised questions about whether the trial was unfairly one-sided. Across the aisle, Charles Ridulph, the older brother of the victim, frowned and bowed his head. More than 58 years ago, he helped search for Maria after she vanished from a street corner near their home while playing in the snow with a friend. McCullough's lawyers and DeKalb County state's attorney Richard Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. McCullough has long insisted that he couldn't possibly have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force when she was taken. He repeated the alibi when he spoke with CNN in prison in March 2013. \"They proved nothing,\" he said at the time. \"I am in here for murder. A murder I would not, could not have done.\" McCullough said that when Maria was kidnapped, the telephone in his home in Sycamore was ringing. And I was on the other end of that phone, in Rockford, three minutes before she was kidnapped. Try and make that happen.

The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent.

McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents—including phone and Air Force records—supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked McCullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened.

Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

The policy states that if users’ spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through their use of Voice Recognition.

The investigation into the bloodstain pattern on the cloth was reported Tuesday in the Journal of Forensic Sciences and is apparently the first such analysis of the controversial shroud. Held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, the shroud shows the image of a crucified man and has been analyzed and scrutinized for many, many years. The Vatican regards it as an icon, rather than a religious relic—and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. In 2015, more than 2 million people saw the Shroud of Turin, which is 14-feet-long, 3.5-feet-wide and kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case. The cloth has long been the subject of debate and study. Researchers concluded that the linen seems to be patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse, reports BuzzFeed News, adding evidence to claims that it is a fraud. \"This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,\" Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, told BuzzFeed News. \"Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.\" Borrini and his colleagues used real and synthetic blood samples to conduct seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric. By pumping blood onto a model at wound points shown on the shroud, researchers could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction depicted on the linen. They found bloodstains that were inconsistent with any single pose, which seems to suggest a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. If it was truly the death shroud of someone hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, \"the bloodstains shouldn't be so inconsistent.\" BuzzFeed reports that researchers found forearm rivulets matched an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, for example, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees.

Ross has also been accused of misleading investors and colleagues, resulting in millions of dollars in fines and lawsuits. Additionally, Ross failed to mention 19 suits in response to a questionnaire during his confirmation process. Ross' questionable assertions and recent controversy about a shipping company that does big business with close associates of Vladimir Putin paint a clearer picture of his tactics. Ross has been described as someone who is not afraid to bend the truth and has lied to many people. Ross' disappearance in 1990 and his subsequent appearance with Donald Trump at the announcement of a deal to recapitalize Trump's Taj Mahal casino are also discussed. Ross' career trajectory is examined, from his early days as a bankruptcy negotiator to his time at WL Ross & Co. and his appointment as Commerce Secretary. Ross' fundraising and spending habits are also discussed, as well as his relationships with other billionaires and his ties to the Palm Beach social scene. Ross' net worth is estimated to be around$400 million, but he has claimed to be worth much more. Ross' former colleagues have expressed surprise at his decision to accept a Cabinet role, given the potential for disclosure of his net worth. Ross' recent statements about a $2 billion gift to his family members are also discussed, and the ethics and tax implications of such a gift are examined. The Department of Commerce has issued a statement denying the existence of the gift, but Ross' former colleagues have expressed skepticism about the truthfulness of his statements. Ross' appointment of a billionaire to promote economic growth has been defended by Donald Trump, who has said that he does not want poor people to hold economic roles in his administration.

It is a rolling series of events that has leaders across the region worrying about similar threats. The very existence of the West African country of Mali is currently under threat. The whole of the north of the country is in the hands of a Tuareg rebellion, which nothing seems able to stop. President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted on March 22 by a junta of captains calling themselves the National Council for the Recovery of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDRE). Taking advantage of the ensuing power vacuum in the capital Bamako, the rebels have gained possession of northern Mali at lightning speed. The rebels, the majority of whom are members of the nomadic Tuareg people, refuse to be called Malian, and they want to establish an independent Tuareg state called Azawad. Currently the rebels only hold the northern part of Mali, but with potential reinforcements arriving from other areas of the Sahel, a transition zone between the Sahara in the north and the savannahs to the south, and in particular from neighboring Niger, that could all change. In the meantime, the Malian army is falling apart. The captains who overthrew the president justified their actions by claiming to be working to end the decline of Mali. However, the coup has had precisely the opposite outcome. Despite the fall of city after city in the north over the past few days, the CNRDRE has not sent any troops north to defend the country from the rebels. West African leaders are responding quickly to try and avoid an outright collapse of the Malian state, and they have reacted with commendable promptness. At the impetus of, in particular, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, a diplomatic emergency committee has been formed that is threatening the junta with heavy sanctions if it does not relinquish power. However, none of the heads of states involved is entirely blameless. Some, like Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaoré, have faced mutinies in their own countries.

Most are placed in institutions by families who are too poor to provide for them, or because of a lack of local education and health facilities, especially for children with special needs. The minority who do not have parents, or for whom staying at home is not in their best interests, are often placed in institutions because there is no alternative. The idea of any child being taken from their family and locked away, all too often in atrocious conditions, is particularly poignant at this time of year.

Over the years, there have been numerous cinematic encounters with lycanthropy, but The Wolf Man is to werewolves what Dracula is to vampires. He is unique. Since Lon Chaney Jr. cast aside the mantle of Lawrence Talbot following his run-in with Abbott and Costello in 1948, no one has picked it up... until now. In accepting the part, Benicio Del Toro isn't playing a werewolf; he is playing the werewolf. For most long-time horror fans, Chaney's portrayal of the tortured Talbot and his vicious alter-ego is as iconic as can be found in the annals of the \"monster movie.\" Del Toro's lack of success, therefore, may be unwelcome but it is not entirely unexpected. It's hard to work in the long shadow cast by the likes of Karloff, Lugosi, or Chaney, but unavoidable when re-making one of their movies.

The book, “Forgetting to Be Afraid,” goes on sale to the general public Tuesday. Copies will be available Monday at a Fort Worth book signing by Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott. Davis, in a copy of the book obtained by the San Antonio Express-News, wrote that her unborn third daughter had an acute brain abnormality. She said doctors told her the syndrome would cause the baby to suffer and likely was incompatible with life. After getting several medical opinions and feeling the baby they had named Tate Elise “tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her” in the womb, she said the decision was clear. “She was suffering,” Davis wrote. The unborn baby's heart was “quieted” by her doctor, and their baby was gone. She was delivered by cesarean section in spring 1997, the memoir says. Davis wrote that she and her then-husband, Jeff, spent time with Tate the next day and had her baptized. They cried, took photographs and said their good-byes, she wrote, and Tate's lifeless body was taken away the following day. “An indescribable blackness followed. It was a deep, dark despair and grief, a heavy wave that crushed me, that made me wonder if I would ever surface.... And when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person. Changed. Forever changed,” Davis wrote. The 304-page hardcover is priced at $27.97 from Blue Rider Press, and imprint of the Penguin Group.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR BP faces opposition from some shareholders for handing Chief Executive Bob Dudley a 20 percent increase in his total remuneration package for 2015 to $19.6 million. It may seem hard to square that amount with BP’s $5.2 billion loss last year, and the fact that it is slashing thousands of jobs in response to falling oil prices. But that’s actually the point. Managing an oil company when crude is trading at $100 per barrel is easy compared to the current environment. Instead, Dudley has to work harder than his predecessors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Dudley, whose pay was going to a non-binding shareholder vote on April 14, has done what was needed of him.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Compared to counterparts, Dudley’s remuneration appears generous. Although Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden pocketed 24.2 million euros ($27.2 million) in 2014, this figure fell to 5.6 million euros last year, according to the company. Over the same period Dudley’s base salary has remained flat, with the biggest boost to his overall financial reward coming through his pension and deferred bonus shares.

Based on its stunningly preserved remains, scientists say the dinosaur’s head and chest seem to have been covered with iridescent feathers akin to those on modern hummingbirds. The flashy display may have provided a social or sexual cue, like modern peacock tails. The dinosaur also has a bird-like body, including the sorts of feathers required for flight, but it has a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor. The ancient animal has been named Caihong juji—Mandarin for “rainbow with the big crest”—the team reports today in the journal Nature Communications. Caihong lived in forests and may have glided from tree to tree, preying on small mammals and lizards, says study co-author Xing Xu, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In life, the duck-size carnivore would’ve weighed roughly a pound. “I was shocked by its beautifully preserved feathers, even though I had seen many feathered dinosaur fossils previously,” adds Xu. Birds—the last living dinosaurs—use feathers today for flight, but feathers also help birds woo potential mates or jockey for social status. Dinosaur fossils suggest that feathers originally evolved for display, only later taking on the traits needed for flight. Like modern and ancient birds, dinosaurs likely had color vision and took advantage of it with striking, feathery displays. In exceptional cases, scientists can reveal dinosaur feathers’ original colors by finding vestiges of pigment sacs called melanosomes within fossilized plumes. (See the full-body coloration of the feathered dinosaur Anchiornis.) When scientists led by Dongyu Hu, a paleontologist at China’s Shenyang Normal University, examined the fossil, they found that its well-preserved remnants contained traces of pigment in its feathers. The team sampled 66 sites across the fossil, comparing the melanosomes they saw with melanosomes from modern bird feathers. On Caihong’s head, chest, and parts of its tail, the researchers saw melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets. These patterns most closely match the melanosomes in the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds. In hummingbirds, similar structures split light like a prism, creating a metallic sheen that changes color with the viewing angle.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The suspect used a 9 mm Glock pistol and brought several magazines for the gun. The gun was hers and was purchased legally. The sheriff wouldn't release any details about the six victims or the shooter, saying that their next of kin were still being notified. No law enforcement officers fired shots during their response. Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center received four patients with \"priority one gunshot wounds.\" Two of the victims were stable and doing well, while two remain seriously injured.

Speaking under an umbrella in pouring rain, Mr. Cosby’s publicist, Andrew Wyatt, said his client’s defeat was part of the “sex war” happening in Washington, comparing it to accusations of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh that are roiling the capital. Mr. Wyatt said that Mr. Cosby, once a beloved actor and comedian, had endured the “most racist and sexist trial” in the country’s history. On Tuesday, Mr. Cosby, 81, was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, Andrea Constand, at his home outside Philadelphia in 2004. Judge Steven T. O’Neill also ruled that Mr. Cosby qualified as a “sexually violent predator” under state law. Shortly after Bill Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison for sexual assault and taken away in handcuffs, his spokesperson Andrew Wyatt told reporters that Cosby — along with embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh — was the victim of a “sex war.” “What is going on in Washington today with Judge Kavanaugh is part of that sex war that Judge [Steven] O’Neill and his wife are a part of,” Wyatt said, referring to the judge who oversaw Cosby’s trial. Wyatt also called Cosby’s trial that resulted in a conviction “the most racist and sexist trial in the history of the United States,” saying that Cosby was “one of the greatest civil rights leaders” and a “great educator of men and boys.” He also criticized the psychologists who testified against Cosby, and claimed that audio footage of Cosby played in the courtroom was falsified. In a particularly bizarre moment, Wyatt referenced the persecution of Jesus while talking about Cosby. “They persecuted Jesus and look what happened,” he said, according to CNN. “Not saying Mr. Cosby’s Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.” Bill Cosby's publicist, Andrew Wyatt, claims both Cosby and Brett Kavanaugh are victims of \"a sex war\" that is \"going on in Washington today.\" pic.twitter.com/jRHOjzUZD7 — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 25, 2018 Wyatt has repeatedly argued that racism played a role in Cosby’s conviction in not-so-subtle terms, calling the", "answers": ["Bill Cosby was labeled a \"violent sexual predator\" by the judge who sentenced him to three to 10 years in prison on Tuesday, but his publicist had a different description: one of the \"greatest civil rights leaders\" in history and one of the \"greatest educators of men and boys.\" Outside the courtroom in Norristown, Pa., publicist Andrew Wyatt claimed the 81-year-old Cosby had faced the \"most racist and sexist trial\" in American history, the New York Times reports.

The video was released by Mexican media outlets and shows a shootout between soldiers and suspected oil thieves in Palmarito in the central state of Puebla. The video shows a shot-up car coming to a halt, coming under further gunfire and eventually being surrounded by soldiers. Minutes later, its doors open and people exiting the vehicle are forced onto the ground in a dimly lit area. Soon afterward, soldiers drag a man who appears to be still alive from the dark area to a well-lit part of the shot, where he lies on the ground for about six minutes before a soldier steps toward him and appears to shoot him in the back of the head. A dark stain then spreads outward from the prone man’s head on the asphalt as soldiers move around. According to the videos posted online and Mexican media, the events took place during a clash between soldiers and suspected oil thieves in Palmarito in the central state of Puebla last week, in which four soldiers and six suspected criminals died. Mexico’s defense ministry has urged federal prosecutors to investigate the video, which threatens to spark a new scandal over the army’s use of extrajudicial force. The ministry said in a statement that prosecutors should “comprehensively clear up” whether the video indeed showed the soldier shooting the detained man after a clash last week between security forces and suspected criminals. In its statement, the defense ministry said soldiers had come under fire from vehicles in Palmarito and had detained some of the attackers. It pledged to cooperate with the attorney general’s office in the investigation. Two shootouts between federal security forces and suspected gang members in 2014 and 2015 that took more than 60 lives prompted accusations by human rights groups that federal forces had carried out extrajudicial killings. Three soldiers are in prison over one of the shootings. A report on Tuesday said Mexico had the second-highest number of murders last year among countries considered in “armed conflicts”. In a statement on Wednesday, the government said the term “armed conflict” used by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in its report was inapplicable to Mexico and that the final murder tally for 2016 was not yet official.

The incident became public after one man got into a dispute over payment with a woman on the morning of April 12, drawing the attention of hotel staff and Colombian authorities, who reported the matter to the U.S. Embassy. The Secret Service recalled its 11 employees and replaced them with another team before Obama arrived April 13. All of the recalled members were placed on administrative leave, and their top-secret security clearances were revoked. The Secret Service announced Wednesday that three of the men were being dismissed from the agency for their involvement. The third man is a junior member of the team who has voluntarily elected to resign. Two senior supervisors, David Chaney and Greg Stokes, are accused in the scandal, which investigators believe included heavy drinking, visits to a strip club and payments to women working as prostitutes. The supervisors were sent on the trip to supervise dozens of younger, less-experienced agents who were part of the advance team preparing for Obama's arrival. The commitment to the Secret Service runs deep in Chaney's family. His father, George Washington Chaney, was a Secret Service agent in President John F. Kennedy's era and knew the agents on his detail when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. The elder Chaney had remarked to friends that he started at the service working \"diaper duty,\" where he watched President Dwight D. Eisenhower's children and grandchildren in Gettysburg, Pa., and also met his wife. Later, he traveled to work in Dallas, where he was on President Lyndon B. Johnson's protective detail. He also served a stint in the service's El Paso office and then became the agent in charge of personnel in the D.C. headquarters, where he was working when Kennedy was shot. He retired in 1977 and started a new line of work as a document examiner in Dallas, where he and his wife raised their five children.

Sept. 29, 2013 Cathryn Carroll of the District yells at Republican House members outside the Capitol as they called on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to summon the Senate back to vote on their budget bill. The United States is bracing for a partial government shutdown after the White House and congressional Democrats declared that they would reject a bill approved by the Republican-led House to delay implementing President Obama's signature health-care law", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The probe will have to withstand heat and radiation never before experienced by any spacecraft, but the specially designed mission will also address questions that couldn't be answered before. Understanding the sun in greater detail can also shed light on Earth and its place in the solar system, researchers said. The mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The mission is scheduled to end in June 2025. The spacecraft will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun. The arrays, or panels, will retract and extend as the spacecraft moves around the sun, keeping it at a safe temperature and also powering it with the sun. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. The 20-day launch window opens July 31, 2018. After testing the assembly, the spacecraft will arrive at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to prep for launch. It's the first time a spacecraft will be named for a living person. Parker, who serves as the S. Chandrasekhar Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago, also attended NASA's announcement Wednesday.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

The leaks are real. But the news about them is fake. The White House is a fine-tuned machine. Russia is a ruse. For its stunning moments and memorable one-liners, Donald Trump's first solo news conference as president has no rivals in recent memory. For all the trappings of the White House and traditions of the forum, his performance was one of a swaggering, blustery campaigner, armed with grievances and primed to unload on his favorite targets. In nearly an hour and a half at the podium, Trump bullied reporters, dismissed facts and then cracked a few caustic jokes — a combination that once made the candidate irresistible cable TV fodder. Now in office, he went even further, blaming the media for all but sinking his not-yet-launched attempt to \"make a deal\" with Moscow. That matters, Trump said in one of his many improvisational asides, because he'd been briefed and \"I can tell you... nuclear holocaust would be like no other.\" This was his and his aides' attempt to get the boss his groove back. Trump used the event to try to claw his young administration back from the brink after a defeat in court and the forced resignation of his top national security adviser. He taunted reporters and waved away their attempts to fact-check him in real time. He (incorrectly) touted his Electoral College total and repeatedly blasted his November opponent — somehow mentioning Hillary Clinton more than anyone else in his defense of his administration's early days. He bragged that his White House is \"a fine-tuned machine\" and claimed \"there has never been a presidency that has done so much in such a short period of time.\" If only the news media would give him credit. Over and over, he accused the political press of being dishonest and suggested that any negative coverage of his administration was \"fake news.\" He unloaded a torrent of grievances while positioning himself as the stand-in for the everyman, who, he declared, hates and distrusts reporters as much as he does. \"The press — the public doesn't believe you people anymore.

Presidential historians tell the AP that no president, including Nixon during the Watergate scandal, has publicly turned on the press the way Trump did. \"It was bizarre theater,\" says Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley. \"He turned a presidential press conference into a reality-TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.\" GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alice Stewart also found a few things to praise in Trump's performance. \"You can't say he's not responsive to the press,\" she tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"He answered all the questions from all over the press corps and put to rest the long-standing dialogue that he shuts down certain news outlets.\" Vox lists nine moments that it suggests back up Jake Tapper's description of the press conference as \"wild\" and \"unhinged,\" including Trump's claim that \"the leaks are real\" but \"the news is fake.\" Late-night hosts approached the press conference as gleefully as a kid unwrapping Christmas presents, and the Washington Post rounds up some of their best lines. \"My guess is he did it because he's mad and he just wanted to blow off some steam,\" Jimmy Kimmel said. \"The tone of the press conference was like if your dad found a pack of cigarettes under your mattress.\" David Graham at the Atlantic looks at the continual theme of complaint in the conference and wonders: Does Trump hate his new job?"], "all_classes": null, "length": 10933}

The two DJs were speaking for the first time since they went into hiding on Saturday when news broke of the the death. They gave interviews to both Channel Nine and Channel Seven's main evening current affairs programs. The DJs said it was supposed to be \"just a simple, harmless, fun call\". The DJs said they thought the joke was on them and their poor accents rather than on the nurses. The DJs reiterated that no one could have expected or foreseen what happened after the call. The DJs said they had not participated in the vetting of the interview. The segment was subject to an internal review, including with 2Day FM's lawyers, before it went to air. The host of the Nine program, Tracey Grimshaw, earlier tweeted that the interview had not been paid for. It was \"neither asked nor offered\", she said. Rhys Holleran, CEO of Southern Cross Austereo, which owns 2Day FM, said the station attempted to contact King Edward VII hospital \"no less than five times\" before broadcasting the pre-recorded material. The company also suspended all prank calls, pulled advertising and ordered a comprehensive review of relevant policies and processes. The DJs, Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who were impersonating Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles, called the hospital Tuesday and gained some information about the condition of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge -- which they subsequently played on air. On Friday, the nurse who transferred the call through to the ward, Jacintha Saldanha, was found dead after apparently committing suicide. The immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill-considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients.

The lawmaker told CNN Tuesday it was unclear when the movement was detected, what the direction of the projectile was and how it was being transported. He attended the briefing by South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) in Seoul on Monday. All eyes have been on North Korea following the country's sixth test of a nuclear weapon Sunday. Seismological data indicated the weapon was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation, nuclear experts said. North Korean state media claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear weapon, which could be fitted atop a long-range missile capable of striking the United States. Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM. The country has test-fired a number of missiles this summer, including two long-range ones in July and an intermediate-range one in August that overflew the Japanese island of Hokkaido. A South Korean lawmaker who attended the Monday briefing, Lee Cheol-woo, told reporters the NIS informed them that Pyongyang had dug extra tunnels at the nuclear test site and could explode another one \"anytime.\" South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his American counterpart, President Donald Trump, spoke by phone Monday and agreed to lift current restrictions on the payload weight of South Korea's ballistic missiles. But signs of a rift between the two leaders have become apparent despite the decades-long alliance between Seoul and Washington. Their phone call came a day after the nuclear test and followed a tweet from Trump in which he criticized South Korea for \"appeasement\" when it comes to dealing with its northern neighbor. Moon has long been a proponent of more dialogue and diplomacy with North Korea, whereas Trump has said recently that \"talking is not the answer.\" Trump spoke twice with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend, once before the nuclear test and once after. Moon and Abe are both traveling to the eastern Russian city of Vladivostok for an economic summit taking place Wednesday and Thursday. They will be joined by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is currently in China for a summit of the BRICS nations -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

Things get pretty vague beyond that: He didn't know the method of transport or when the movement was noticed. But Reuters does pick up some alleged details on those fronts, via an unnamed source quoted by South Korea’s Asia Business Daily. Its source says the ICBM started moving Monday, is only being moved at night, and is headed toward the nation's west coast. Reuters notes there's some likelihood that another test could come on or around Saturday: Sept. 9 is the country's founding day holiday. CNBC notes North Korea conducted a nuke test on Sept. 9, 2016. Two more details that allegedly came from the South's National Intelligence Service briefing: word that additional tunnels have been dug out at the North's nuclear test site that would facilitate future detonations, and suspicions that the next ICBM test firing might be directed toward the North Pacific but aimed at a lower angle, which would in theory allow it to fly further than previous tests, which had more of an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the White House tells Reuters it has given \"in-principle approval\" to a request by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to abolish a limit regarding warhead weights, a move that would strengthen the power with which it could attack the North, if necessary.

The incident began Thursday morning when a deputy responding to a report of a stolen vehicle spotted Jones with what he thought was a weapon, Salazar said. Jones, on several occasions, \"physically threatened him with that weapon and verbalized to him that she intended to shoot him with that weapon,\" the sheriff said. The suspect managed to get away, and deputies did not see her again until a couple of hours later, when she turned up at the mobile home park where Kameron lived, Salazar said. She forced her way into Kameron's home, threatened to shoot members of his family and said she was taking their vehicle, the sheriff said, adding that Jones had no apparent ties to the boy or his relatives. When Jones left the home, the deputies were outside, waiting. Salazar said witnesses heard the woman threaten to shoot the law enforcement officers. \"Those deputies all report in their statements that she was holding an object in her hand they believed it to be a weapon at the time,\" Salazar said.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "    Humans arrived in the arid interior of Australia some 10,000 years earlier than we thought, archaeologists suggest, with the discovery of ancient artefacts in a South Australian cave that have been dated to as far back as 49,000 years ago. The site, which is a newly discovered cave in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, is known as the Warratyi rock-shelter. Archaeologist Giles Hamm from La Trobe University in Melbourne led the excavations at the cave, finding what appear to be some of the oldest bone and quartz tools ever found in Australia, plus the earliest known use of the pigment ochre in the country’s history. Artefacts that have been found so far include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre and gypsum pigments, and the team says this is evidence that these early technologies were developed locally. The old idea is that people might have come from the East, from the Levant, out of Africa, and these modern humans may have come with a package of innovative technologies. But the development of these fine stone tools, the bone technology, we think that happened as a local innovation, due to a local cultural evolution. That’s significant, adds one of the team, Gavin Prideaux from Flinders University in Adelaide, because it challenges certain assumptions that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in on the globe. There is a Eurocentric view that material culture in Australia is quite simplistic and backward, but this helps rewrite that story. Until now, the oldest human tool found in Australia’s vast, arid interior has been a tiny axe fragment found earlier this year in the Carpenter's Gap rock-shelter of the Kimberley region of northwest Australia. While the Carpenter’s Gap site is not far from the northwest coast of Australia - thought to be one of the earliest settled parts of Australia - the Warratyi rock-shelter sits more than 2,000 km from the early settlement of Lake Mungo in southeasten New South Wales, making it a much more difficult trek.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Vogelsang returned to Red River College, working on a part-time basis sometime after moving back to Winnipeg from Nelson B.C., in 2014, up until this past summer. Vogelsang, 53, was charged with two counts of robbery in connection to two bank robberies in Medicine Hat, Alta. Police said a man went into a Royal Bank of Canada on Thursday October 19 and a Bank of Montreal on Friday October 20. They said in both instances, the man passed a note to a teller and received money. The amount is not being released. Vogelsang is expected to appear in court tomorrow. It appears Vogelsang is going through financial difficulties. Court documents obtained by CTV News detail his divorce. He was accused of missing several mortgage payments on a home in Winnipeg, and borrowing money. Court records also show he was charged with sexual assault in September 2016. That charge was stayed October 23, 2017. A protection order was filed and granted in March 2017. Court documents show he faces three charges of disobeying a court order, laid in August 2017. A justice official tells CTV News those charges are expected to be dealt with in court next year. Former students who said the allegations are shocking. Vogelsang was a tough, but fair teacher—one who built his lessons and rapport with us through a mix of fun and humour, always challenging us to step outside our comfort zones and to be better than our last assignment.

Oakleigh started off on 4 liters of oxygen and within 3 days she was breathing nothing but air and saturating between 98 and 100%. In the NICU, they used to call her Miss Sassy because of her ability to express her displeasure with her circumstances. Oakleigh had grown normally and her health was excellent up until a couple of months ago when she came down with a sudden fever. Out of nowhere, her fever spiked to 104. It just so happened that Oakleigh had a severe UTI that probably had invaded her kidneys. After going on antibiotics, the fever went away but returned a week later. She has battled with reoccurring infections over the latest months and was then hospitalized for further testing. The tests revealed that Oakleigh has stage 3 kidney reflux. This is rather common with this condition, but the bacteria associated with her infection was a dangerous, antibiotic resistant strain of Pseudomonas. While she was in the hospital, tests were done on her heart which revealed moderate ASD and pulmonary stenosis. This is especially concerning when you consider the infection and the involvement of the kidneys. Oakleigh is currently scheduled for surgery at the end of this month. They will be operating to fix the reflux in her left kidney, which now has 22% functionality, in hopes to eliminate future infections. This will be about a 4 ½ hour procedure. Her left kidney is actually 2 kidneys, with 2 different ureters which will have to be cut back to a length that will prevent reflux. She will also have to have a pocket on the outside of the kidney removed. The next step after healing from the surgery is to meet with the cardiologist to discuss additional testing for her heart condition. Oakleigh has a long road ahead of her, but God has her hand every step of the way and for that we are extremely thankful. Oakleigh is surrounded by a loving and supportive family and on their behalf, we thank you for your support. God Bless! What is a pseudomonas infection?

The spokesman, Ed Donovan, said Crudup would be charged with unlawful entry and contempt of court. The contempt charge was to be brought in connection with an order requiring the man to stay away from the White House.

The company will pay a $40,000 fine and produce a video about lead safety. Magnolia will also spend $160,000 on a lead-abatement project in Waco, Texas. The project will reduce the risk of exposure to lead-based paint in at-risk residences. The EPA says Magnolia has looked for ways to make a concrete difference in its local community. The company has also taken steps to ensure compliance with lead-based paint regulations in future renovation projects. The violations were noticed because someone at the EPA saw it. The agency said in a statement they had witnessed the violations when they reviewed several seasons of the show. The EPA has a whole department that's just people with hangovers binge-watching home-renovation shows with the rest of us. In addition to the fine, Magnolia will pay to produce some lead-awareness bonus content for their web site and social-media accounts. The video will star Chip Gaines and aim to to make fans aware of how to be lead-safe, and hopefully it'll be ready in time for July 5. The couple, who do business as Magnolia Homes, reached a settlement in a case that could have cost them $556,000 in fines. In a settlement \"information sheet\" posted on the EPA's website, the agency notes that the \"activities of Magnolia and similar renovation firms came to EPA's attention from their depiction on popular television shows. Magnolia's renovations were depicted on the HGTV series 'Fixer Upper' and regularly viewed by well over 3 million households.\" The EPA says Magnolia engaged in \"home renovations conducted without adequate lead paint protections as depicted on the television program Fixer Upper.\" The series recently completed its fifth and final season on HGTV. In addition to the $40,000 fine, the settlement requires Chip Gaines to produce and release an educational video highlighting the dangers of lead-based paint within 90 days. Also, the couple has agreed to spend $160,000 on a lead-abatement project in their hometown of Waco, Texas. The project, to be performed with an independent abatement firm, will reduce the risk of exposure to lead-based paint in at-risk residences by replacing windows and doors, removing lead-based paint and dust, and replacing lead-based paint surfaces and fixtures, among other chores.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

In addition to the new boarding process, United is also launching push notifications for those who have the airline's mobile app. Those who opt in will be given a push notification when boarding starts, which will be particularly useful if a flight is delayed or if the ground crew decides to load the aircraft early. This week's updates come as the latest milestone in a long history of experimentation that United and other airlines have performed around the boarding process. Several years ago, United started using five lanes to feed through passengers, but this created a fair amount of idle, standing passengers and congestion near the gate. The new strategy launched this week helps alleviate that problem. Indeed, some of United's peers are already using this simplified process. American Airlines currently boards by zone using only two lanes while Delta Air Lines splits the difference and boards with four. One difference between United and its competitors, however, is that as of this week, top tier or \"1K\" elite members will be able to pre-board before the official process starts; with most carriers only VIP passengers are given that access. New boarding lanes and gateside notifications should roll out to airports this week.

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

The storm is expected to hit Virginia, Maryland, and the District later Saturday and into Sunday morning. Late-summer vacationers evacuate Atlantic coast beaches, which are expected to be hit hardest before the storm wallops New England. The intensity of the storm and the shift in the forecast track farther to the west prompt the decision to delay the memorial dedication. Governors along the coast, including those in Virginia and Maryland, declare states of emergency. Thousands of weekend events are canceled. A significant storm surge is expected to flood coastal areas, and wind-driven flooding may occur along the shores of the Chesapeake Bay. The worst of the weather is likely to be east of the Interstate 95 corridor, which may get four to six inches of rain, prolonged winds of 50 to 70 mph, and gusts of 90 to 100 mph. Amtrak cancels train departures from Southeastern states and curtails some service in the Northeast. Airports expect flight delays and cancellations through the weekend. An endless stream of vacationers rolls across the bridge out of Ocean City, and homeowners rush in the opposite direction to board up their rental properties.

Activists have criticized the department for targeting low-income residents and ignoring the debts of large entities. The department has responded by saying it needs to recoup some $175 million in outstanding bills and that there are sufficient payment plans and assistance programs in place to help those who fall behind on their bills. However, nearly 50 percent of DWSD's accounts are behind on payments, and Detroit's already-high water prices are on the rise. Activists say those high numbers give residents no choice but to protest. The pressure seems to be partially working: DWSD announced a $1 million fund on Tuesday for residents struggling to pay. But even with the $1 million, activists say many others are likely to lose access to water over the summer. If the shutoffs continue, they say, DWSD can expect larger protests. The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department announced Wednesday that it is intensifying efforts to collect unpaid debts from its delinquent commercial customers. Shut-off crews are now mobilizing to go out and cut service to delinquent commercial customers, which make up about 12% of the approximately 90,000 accounts that are at least 60 days past due. Meanwhile, the DWSD has been shutting off water service aggressively for its delinquent residential customers. Activists who have protested the shut-offs as an affront to human rights have for weeks criticized the water department for ignoring commercial deadbeats. In response, water officials steadfastly maintained that their collection efforts, which began in March, included commercial properties. However, the department's contractor to help carry out the shut-offs is equipped to handle only residential properties. The department had to make arrangements for its own employees to cut off service for commercial customers, Latimer said, adding that the recipients of the 46,000 shut-off notices sent out in May included commercial properties.

In addition to mailings, the department is physically posting shut-off notices on those buildings in case they house rentals for apartments or office spaces.

But Cruz Riojas' tendency toward frequent, violent outbursts made it difficult for Hooper to think of him as anything other than a \"holy terror.\" In the 33 years following that school year at Brown Elementary School, however, Riojas would not only change Hooper's opinion of him forever - he would also change his last name. Infamous classroom legend \"There evidently is a very thin line between love and hate,\" Hooper said during an hourlong interview at her home last week. Cruz, who lives in San Antonio, was in West Texas visiting family for the Fourth of July weekend.

Other times, he threw chairs or stabbed his peers. His academic standing made for an extra challenge. He had dyslexia and was two grade levels behind in reading, so he was considered a special education student. By the time Cruz reached sixth grade, he had become a Brown Elementary legend.

He died on Friday at age 94. His wife of more than 70 years, Barbara, died at the age of 92 earlier this year. Mr. Bush was the last American president to serve in World War II, a fight that helped shape his life and the lives of many in his generation. He went on to build a sterling resume—businessman, member of Congress, envoy to the United Nations and China, head of the Central Intelligence Agency—before becoming Republican Ronald Reagan’s vice president in 1980 and then succeeding him in the White House in the election in 1988. He lost his bid for re-election to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, after a campaign in which he was hampered by two years of disappointing economic performance and an insurrection among his own party’s conservatives over a decision to raise taxes. The loss was a bitter personal disappointment, but one he handled with the kind of grace that allowed him to become friends with Mr. Clinton in later life. In subsequent years, historians have been far kinder regarding the Bush presidency than were voters at the time. Mr. Bush also won some degree of vindication when his eldest son, George W. Bush, won the White House in 2000, making Mr. Bush the only American since John Adams to be both a president and father of a president. George H.W. Bush was born June 12, 1924, in Milton, Mass.

The son appeared set to follow his father’s steps from elite prep school to Yale and on to a career in the financial industry when World War II broke out. The younger Mr. Bush joined the Navy and, when sworn in on his 18th birthday, became its youngest pilot. He flew 58 missions in the Pacific, piloting an Avenger torpedo bomber—with his girlfriend Barbara’s name painted on its side—from an aircraft carrier.

Two people were critically wounded in a shooting at a parking garage on Feb. 6, and a tourist was stabbed Saturday in an elevator at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay. A spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, Jeremy Handel, reassured people that much is being done to keep them safe. Las Vegas Police Officer Jose Hernandez acknowledged that the Strip has seen several violent incidents in recent weeks but said police have made arrests or identified suspects in each case.

Rapper Tupac Shakur was killed in a drive-by in 1996 about a block away under similar circumstances, as assailants opened fire on his luxury sedan from a vehicle on Flamingo Road. The killing has never been solved. The shooting was the talk of the area, even among the denizens of the night, such as Paul Pillat, 58, formerly of Milwaukee, Wis. He described himself as a homeless person who has been trawling the streets for years. He said he was known by his street name, Tumbleweed, and he was heading to a fast-food restaurant near the intersection about 4:20 a.m. when he heard the gunshots.

Write a one-page summary of all news. \n\nNews: overposting\n\n    Passage 1: Gaza/Jerusalem Israel's cabinet authorized the mobilization of up to 75,000 reservists late on Friday, preparing the ground for a possible Gaza invasion after Palestinians fired a rocket toward Jerusalem for the first time in decades. Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial centre, also came under rocket attack for the second straight day, in defiance of an Israeli air offensive that began on Wednesday with the declared aim of deterring Hamas from launching cross-border attacks that have plagued southern Israel for years. Hamas, the Islamist group that runs the Gaza Strip, claimed responsibility for firing at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Israel said the rocket launched toward Jerusalem landed in the occupied West Bank, and the one fired at Tel Aviv did not hit the city. There were no reports of casualties. The siren that sounded in Jerusalem stunned many Israelis. The city, holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, was last struck by a Palestinian rocket in 1970, and it was not a target when Saddam Hussein's Iraq fired missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a four-hour strategy session with a clutch of senior ministers in Tel Aviv on widening the military campaign, while other cabinet members were polled by telephone on raising the mobilization level. Political sources said they decided to more than double the current reserve troop quota set for the Gaza offensive to 75,000. The move did not necessarily mean all would be called into service. Hours earlier, Egypt's prime minister, denouncing what he described as Israeli aggression, visited Gaza and said Cairo was prepared to mediate a truce. Officials in Gaza said 29 Palestinians - 13 militants and 16 civilians, among them eight children and a pregnant woman - had been killed in the enclave since Israel began its air strikes. Three Israeli civilians were killed by a rocket on Thursday. The Israeli military said 97 rockets fired from Gaza hit Israel on Friday and 99 more were intercepted by its Iron Dome anti-missile system. Dozens of Israeli bombing raids rocked the enclave, and one flattened the Gaza Interior Ministry building. In a further sign Netanyahu might be clearing the way for a ground operation, Israel's armed forces announced that a highway leading to the territory and two roads bordering the enclave of 1.7 million Palestinians would be off-limits to civilian traffic. Tanks and self-propelled guns were seen near the border area on Friday, and the military said", "answers": ["A brief, planned ceasefire failed to materialize in Gaza today, as death continued to rain down on the strip. Israel had offered to hold its offensive to accommodate a visit from Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, provided Hamas held its fire as well. But Hamas said it would keep firing, and one Israeli defense minister complained that 50 rockets had flown in from Gaza during Kandil's visit, CNN reports. A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times. Israel has now hit 250 Gaza targets, while taking further steps toward a ground invasion, calling up 16,000 reservists, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's also steadily sending troops and armored vehicles to the border, notes CNN—between 1,500 and 2,000 are already there, one official said. Israel claims the attacks have weakened Hamas' military capabilities and caused its attacks to lighten, but Hamas denied that, saying it had hit multiple Israeli targets today. Kandil emerged from his meeting with Hamas expressing solidarity, saying the new Egyptian regime would be more active in helping the Palestinians. \"The time has changed,\" he said. \"No longer the Israeli occupation will be able to carry out their attacks against the Palestinians without being held responsible. That time is far bygone.\" For its part, the Obama administration says it's seeking help from Arab countries in calling on Hamas to relent. \"The onus rests squarely on Hamas ... to stop its rocket attacks,\" says a State Department spokesman.

The ocean was a mile deep in places and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water. The discovery adds to an emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, with streams, river deltas, and long-standing lakes. The scientists used infrared telescopes to map the Martian atmosphere and study the evolution of sublimation from the north polar cap. The maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 VSMOW, which would mean that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters. But Mars was probably never completely submerged. Based on the Martian terrain today, the scientists believe the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface. The Atlantic, by comparison, covers about 17% of Earth's surface. The scientists also found that the ancient ocean lasted for millions of years before the Martian atmosphere thinned and the ocean receded and eventually froze. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up in the Martian polar caps. The discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars has implications for the search for life on the planet.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The incident occurred hours after Pippa attended a decadent 18th century-themed party thrown by her close friend, the French aristocrat and designer Vicomte Arthur de Soultrait. The party was filled with \"feathers, baubles, jewels and privileged youngsters\" and concluded with a stripper bursting out of a giant birthday cake before disrobing to a remix of God Save The Queen. Pippa, dubbed \"Her Royal Hotness\", appeared relaxed and in a celebratory mood during the party. The incident has sparked controversy and could cause embarrassment to the Royal Family as the Queen prepares to celebrate her Diamond Jubilee. The French authorities are investigating the incident after receiving a complaint from a member of the public. If they prosecute, Pippa could be called as a witness. The crime itself carries a maximum seven-year jail sentence. The driver of the car, who has yet to be identified, allegedly reached for a what appeared to be a semi-automatic gun and jokingly aimed it at a paparazzi following them. The image shows Middleton, the younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, looking back at the paparazzo and grinning as her friend, the driver, reaches down and aims what appears to be the gun. The gun was not real, according to a spokesperson for Arthur de Soultrait's fashion company, Vicomte A. The spokesperson said it was just a stupid joke. The Paris police are now saying that all four of the people in the car could face arrest, and possibly, imprisonment for up to two years.

They also argue that a recent Supreme Court ruling about the vagueness of the definition of a \"crime of violence\" throws many convictions into question. The legal term \"crime of violence\" was applied to Tsarnaev's actions. Attorneys for Tsarnaev appealed his conviction and death sentence, arguing that publicity made it impossible for him to get a fair trial in Boston and that capital punishment is unconstitutional.

Soldiers fired in the air during the inspection, prompting an immediate strengthening of security around the presidential palace. Troops are upset with the government's handling of a Tuareg rebellion in the north of the country, and are also reportedly opposed to any potential talks with the rebels.

Dean-Charles Chapman is currently known on Game of Thrones for playing King Tommen Baratheon, first of his name and however it goes, who took the throne in Season 4 after his brother Joffrey's death. But Chapman has only played Tommen since 2014, because the character was recast from the much younger actor, Callum Wharry. But oddly, Chapman was in the show before then, by the name of a tiny lordling named Martyn Lannister. Hello Giggles first caught the similarities, noticing that the the king who's \"only half-Lannister\" looks exactly like his pure-blooded Lannister cousin (and also, IMDb says so). For reference, that's Tommen on the left and Martyn on the right: It's an easy thing to miss because poor Martyn Lannister only appeared for two episodes in the third season before getting the axe. For those who remember way back when Robb Stark had an army and was alive, Martyn and Willem Lannister were taken as hostages by Robb's army.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PS4 lead system architect Mark Cerny talked about how the evolution of the PS4 came about, saying it began five years ago, earlier on in the life of the PS3.

The hacker, operating under the name The Dark Overlord, has already purportedly uploaded the first episode to an illegal file-sharing service. The Associated Press could not legally confirm the authenticity of that uploaded file. New episodes of \"Orange\" are scheduled for official release on June 9. Netflix said that a small production vendor that works with several major TV studios had suffered a breach. The Los Gatos, California, company described it as an \"active situation\" that's being investigated by the FBI and other authorities. Pirated copies of \"Orange\" could dent Netflix's subscriber growth and the company's stock price. In the ransom note, The Dark Overlord claimed to have stolen series from other studios, too, by breaking into a single company. The purported hacker promised to also release those titles unless \"modest\" ransoms are paid. Rumors of a massive leak of Hollywood films and TV episodes have been circulating online for months, fed by purported screenshots of the footage and a copy of a proposed deal to delete the stolen material in return for tens of thousands of dollars in electronic currency. When the AP contacted The Dark Overlord in February, the hacker said the purloined video wouldn't be made publicly available after all, making the far-fetched claim that \"no one really (cares) about unreleased movies and TV show episodes.\" It's not clear what triggered The Dark Overload's renewed ransom demands.

{"pred": "    The news is about the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Statistical tools can't answer the questions about the plane's location and cause of disappearance, but Bayesian statisticians can help refine and focus the search. Bayesian methods allow hunters to update their estimates of the probability of finding the plane in any latitude-longitude combination. The methods have been used in searches for U-boats, a U.S. submarine, and an Air France jet. New developments in the search for Flight 370, such as information about how the plane's communication systems were shut off, have lowered the probability that the plane disappeared due to an accident and increased the likelihood of deliberate diversion. Bayesian inference formalizes common sense by assigning probabilities to new situations. Our first estimate of these probabilities may be no better than an educated guess, but we can update our probability based on new information. Bayesian methods require calculation of a probability distribution for every point in the search area. The current search for Flight 370 involves four dimensions: the plane's location, the cause of disappearance, the probability of finding the plane at any given location, and the probability of deliberate diversion. Bayesian methods allow searchers to update their estimates as new information comes in. The Metron team helped find the wreckage of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009. The search was successful because the team used Bayesian methods to update their estimates as new information came in. The team had to account for the possibility that an earlier search covered an area including the wreckage site but missed it. The team also had to account for the possibility that the beacons on the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder malfunctioned. The team's estimates were based on past crashes, which yielded an 80% probability that the beacons were unscathed. The team's estimates were also based on subjective judgment, which is a crucial input into the search. The Malaysian government and Malaysia Airlines are not using Bayesian methods in the current search, but they are getting help from a team of French government investigators who worked on the Air France hunt. Bayesian methods are not a perfect fit for the Malaysia Airlines search, but they should make searchers most effective in adapting to changing information. Other advocates of Bayesian stats point to their usefulness in bringing discipline to what can be a difficult search process.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

Durst has been held in Louisiana since his arrest, but he will soon be transferred to California to face a murder charge in connection with the death of his friend Susan Berman. Durst has steadfastly maintained his innocence in Berman's killing, and his attorneys have said repeatedly that he is innocent and does not know who killed Berman. Durst's attorneys have requested that he be housed at a low-security federal prison facility in California while he awaits trial in Berman's death. The deal with federal prosecutors would have Durst back in California by August 18 for his arraignment in the murder case. However, it is likely that Durst will leave within a few weeks for California, assuming the federal Bureau of Prisons accepts the judge's recommendation. The gun charge stemmed from a search of Durst's hotel room in New Orleans, which turned up a loaded Smith and Wesson.38-caliber revolver. Durst's attorney said he has forfeited the handgun and other items as part of his plea deal. The deal also includes stipulations that authorities in New York will not prosecute Durst over financial maneuvering while on the lam, and that prosecutors in Texas and New Orleans will not pursue further gun counts against him. The deal \"cleared the decks\" for Durst, allowing him to focus on the murder charge in California. Durst's attorneys have said they are confident he will beat the murder rap.

After 12 months apart, friends say Cruise has taken the surprising step of writing to his ex in an attempt to rekindle their friendship, if not more. \"[He wrote an] emotional letter. I think it's something Tom's been thinking about a lot recently, but especially as July was approaching,\" an insider told UK magazine Look. \"It's like he's finally recognised that Katie will always be the love of his life.

The final round of voting is expected to consolidate the gains made by Islamist groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party. The trial of Mubarak has resumed after a two-month hiatus, and the prosecution is seeking the harshest penalty against him. The prosecution has accused Mubarak of being a \"tyrant\" who sought to install his son, Gamal, in his place, and of allowing former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli to \"practice oppression and violence against Egyptians.\" The final stage of the vote covers nine provinces, including the North and South Sinai governorates. The election and Mubarak's trial take place amid growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they won't cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June. The new parliament will likely witness political struggles between the military council, the Brotherhood, and Salafis, and the revolutionary forces. Economic growth has slowed as the unrest deters tourists and investors. The Brotherhood's party, Freedom and Justice, is expected to win a clear majority of the seats in the full Parliament. The Brotherhood has said it intends to form a coalition or unity government, but winning a clear majority would enable it to govern without forming a coalition. The ultraconservative Islamists, known as Salafis, have so far come in second-place in the first two rounds of the voting, winning as much as 25 percent of the seats. The Brotherhood has allied itself with the liberals rather than the most conservative Islamists. The Brotherhood expects the Parliament to take authority over the hiring and firing of a prime minister to run the interim government, but the military rulers have said they intend to retain that authority. The lower house of Parliament is Egypt's primarily legislative body, and Field Marshall Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the top military officer who is now acting as de facto chief executive, has scheduled its first session for Jan. 23. The trial of Mubarak has resumed amid speculation that a recent acquittal of policemen involved in the killing of protesters was politically motivated.
