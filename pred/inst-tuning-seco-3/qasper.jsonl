The number of clusters was varied between 250 and 1000, and the type of word vectors was varied between skipgram, cbow, and GloVe. The hyperparameters were varied to determine the optimal settings for each task. The results suggest that using low-dimensional skipgram embeddings with high numbers of clusters is a good starting point for the tasks, and that using out-of-domain data to construct word embeddings can also be effective.
