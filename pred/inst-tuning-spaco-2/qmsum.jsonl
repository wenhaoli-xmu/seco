The industrial designer preferred traditional batteries, titanium and simple push buttons so that they would have enough money for speech recognition. After that, the group talked about LCD display and locating methods. The second topic was user interface concept, which was basically a good-looking design with few buttons. The group decided to change the colour of the assembly at an extra charge to meet special needs. To make a smart controller, they mentioned speech recognition and user identification.

The curved shape made it more ergonomic and comfortable to hold, while the single button and scroll wheel made it easier to use and navigate.

The reasons for this are that there are fewer people entering the teaching profession and that there are more people leaving the profession. The steps that the Welsh Government has taken to address this issue include increasing the number of teacher training places, offering financial incentives to teachers, and working with schools to improve working conditions. The Welsh Government is also working with the UK Government to address the issue of teacher recruitment across the UK.  davidjl・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━・━", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.
