About 100 Occupy Philly protesters sat down on the cold concrete of Dilworth Plaza at 5 p.m. Sunday and waited to be rousted for violating a deadline Mayor Nutter had set for the group to leave. But the expected police eviction had not happened by late Sunday evening, and city officials continued to avoid saying when, or whether, they would throw the Occupiers and their tents off City Hall's so-called front lawn. We are expecting people to pack up and leave, said Mark McDonald, spokesman for Mayor Nutter. I'm not going to speculate about what the city might do at any time down the road from now. For about 90 minutes, protesters chanted slogans such as, What does democracy look like? This is what democracy looks like. They served squash soup in paper cups, handed out bottles of water, and railed against what they believe is excessive corporate greed and power. All the while, police looked on calmly. Police had no plans to evict anyone, Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan said about 6:30 p.m. We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem.

I definitely, definitely want to really stress that the vast majority of people participating in this movement have been cooperative, nonviolent, and very respectful, he said. Sullivan cautioned, however, that protesters would be prevented from setting up another camp elsewhere in the city unless they got a permit. The city has said it needs to erect fencing this week for work at Dilworth Plaza, including renovation of the SEPTA tunnels and the addition of grass, a cafe, stage, and winter ice rink. Over the last few days, Occupy Philly participants, many homeless, had begun to take down their tents. By 7:15 p.m. Sunday, roughly a third of what originally was about 300 tents were gone. Darrin Annussek, an unemployed career counselor, and William Tuttle, a student, were folding up Annussek's tent Sunday.

The inventor of the Kalashnikov assault rifle apparently wrote to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church before he died expressing fears he was morally responsible for the people it killed. Mikhail Kalashnikov, who died last month aged 94, wrote a long emotional letter to Patriarch Kirill in May 2012, church officials say. He said he was suffering \"spiritual pain\" over the many deaths it caused. Kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for those killed. The letter published by Izvestia provides a fascinating insight into the mind of the man who created Russia's most famous weapon. Mikhail Kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles. More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide. The gun brought Kalashnikov fame and a string of awards. But his letter to the Patriarch suggests that, towards the end of his life, Kalashnikov felt a degree of guilt - or \"spiritual pain\" as he puts it - for having invented a killing machine.

Kalashnikov, who died in December at the age of 94, in April wrote a lengthy emotional letter to Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill, Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, reported on Monday. \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" he asked.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

Jack McCullough, 76, was serving a life sentence for the 1957 murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. McCullough was freed shortly after the hearing and was whisked away in a car driven by a family member. After the judge's ruling, McCullough turned toward his stepdaughter, Janey O'Connor, and flashed her a private signal that she says means \"I love you.\" She was seated behind him and broke into tears but managed a big smile back. Maria Ridulph's murder went unsolved for half a century. Then detectives pursued a tip, and a man was brought to trial and convicted in the 1957 murder of the 7-year-old in Sycamore, Illinois. Now that man is free. Ann O'Neill's 2013 series on the case, \"Taken,\" raised questions about whether the trial was unfairly one-sided. Across the aisle, Charles Ridulph, the older brother of the victim, frowned and bowed his head. More than 58 years ago, he helped search for Maria after she vanished from a street corner near their home while playing in the snow with a friend. McCullough's lawyers and DeKalb County state's attorney Richard Schmack argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi.

He repeated the alibi when he spoke with CNN in prison in March 2013. \"They proved nothing,\" he said at the time. \"I am in here for murder. A murder I would not, could not have done.\" McCullough said that when Maria was kidnapped, the telephone in his home in Sycamore was ringing. \"And I was on the other end of that phone, in Rockford, three minutes before she was kidnapped.

It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents—including phone and Air Force records—supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial.

{"pred": "Cigarette smoke has long been known to have a multitude of damaging effects, but recent research has shown that it also fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs. According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. This is because cigarette smoke alters the cell walls of the bacteria, making them more resistant to common forms of immune responses. Another study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine a year earlier suggested something similar with e-cigarette smoke; vaporized smoke can also alter the structure of MRSA’s cell wall to make it more resistant to bacteria. However, this research also discovered that surface changes to the bacteria increased 10 times more with exposure to cigarette smoke rather than e-cigarette vapor. Cigarette smokers are known to be more susceptible to infectious diseases, and this study provides evidence that cigarette smoke-induced resistance in MRSA may be an additional contributing factor. Through their finding, the researchers hope to add yet another reason to why individuals should refrain from smoking. In a separate study, UC San Diego scientists found that cigarette smoke functions much like an alarm to the superbug MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke extract become harder to kill. The study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. MRSA exposed to the smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. In addition, the smoke-exposed MRSA became more resistant antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. Worse, the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions, which means a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. When exposed to cigarette smoke, MRSA also became better at invading human cells in lab cultures.

But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

The study takes as its starting point Google's PageRank algorithm, which says that a page is important if a lot of important pages link to it. The study applied PageRank to figures on Wikipedia, and the results were odd. The most important person in the world comes out as Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist. To get around that issue, the researchers applied a second way of measuring importance: CheiRank. Mix Pagerank and CheiRank together, and you get the final measure: 2DRank. That's how the authors arrived at the top 100 for all 24 editions of Wikipedia – and how Frank Sinatra took pole position.

In an intriguing new study, a team led by University of Tolouse researcher Young-Ho Eom sought to figure out who, exactly, should be considered the most influential thinker in the world. Trawling through 24 different language editions of Wikipedia, Eom's team calculated whose intellectual fingers stretched out the furthest. The result was... somewhat surprising. According to Eom and co., the world's most influential mind was Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. Linnaeus beat out everyone, from the Pope to President Obama to Frank Sinatra, Hitler, Caesar—even Jesus. It was Linnaeus' particular scientific penchant, combined with the specifics of Young-Ho Eom's method of searching Wikipedia, says New Scientist, that led to the unexpected result: “Linnaeus topped the chart across all languages because there are so many Wikipedia pages with scientific names in every edition, and they all eventually lead back to him.” This isn't the first time people have tried to figure out the influence of various historical people, of course, and Linnaeus is not a reliable entrant on the list.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events.

The policy has drawn the ire of internet users, who compared it with George Orwell’s dystopian fiction 1984. While voice recognition software almost always transmits data on what users are saying, the combination of sending the data to third-parties and the comparison with Orwell has meant that the Samsung policy has drawn particular attention. The policy states that if users’ spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through their use of Voice Recognition. It makes clear that the tool can be turned off through settings, though that will stop the voice recognition working entirely and Samsung will still continue to collect data about how people use the TV. The policy bears similarities to the telescreens used in 1984, as pointed out by Twitter user and Electronic Frontier Foundation activist Parker Higgins. In that book, Orwell writes that Winston’s every sound would be picked up by the screen, and that there was no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. A Samsung statement said that data is encrypted to keep it safe, and that owners can disconnect the TV from wifi if they want to keep their data safe. Users can tell when the feature is activated because a microphone appears on screen. Many saw the policy as a warning about the internet of things, which some say could allow companies to collect more data on its users than ever before.

The syndrome is rare but more than double compared to 2015. AFM can be caused by a variety of germs, such as enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. Symptoms include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The best prevention is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes. The illness seemed to peak in 2014, with 120 cases reported between August and December. The average age for children stricken with AFM is 7, and many had to be placed on respirators. Although 85% of the children recovered partially, only three have fully recovered. The news also reports on a family whose daughter, Laura, developed AFM in 2014. She spent 25 days in the hospital, bedridden and unable to walk. At her worst, she could only move parts of her left arm and left leg. Months of rehabilitation followed, with Laura receiving intensive physical, speech, and occupational therapy. Today, she is doing much better and continues to improve. The family is thankful for every little blessing and gain they make. The news also highlights the importance of being up to date on vaccinations and practicing good hygiene to prevent viral infections, including poliomyelitis, which can present with acute flaccid paralysis. The news also encourages caregivers to contact a health care provider if a child appears to have a sudden onset of weakness in arms or legs. Health care providers are encouraged to report patients meeting the case definition to their state or local health department. Health departments should report patients with illness meeting the case definition to CDC using a brief patient summary form and may contact CDC by email to arrange further laboratory testing. Additional information is available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncird/investigation/viral/sep2014.html. The news concludes by stating that although the specific causes of this illness are still under investigation, being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent a number of severe diseases.

The investigation into the bloodstain pattern on the cloth was reported Tuesday in the Journal of Forensic Sciences and is apparently the first such analysis of the controversial shroud. Held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, the shroud shows the image of a crucified man and has been analyzed and scrutinized for many, many years. The Vatican regards it as an icon, rather than a religious relic—and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. In 2015, more than 2 million people saw the Shroud of Turin, which is 14-feet-long, 3.5-feet-wide and kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case. The cloth has long been the subject of debate and study. Researchers concluded that the linen seems to be patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or a facedown corpse, reports BuzzFeed News, adding evidence to claims that it is a fraud. “This is the kind of forensic work done all the time in police investigations,” Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, told BuzzFeed News. “Even a crucified or hanging person should leave a distinct blood pattern on the cloth, which would be fascinating information to have.” Borrini and his colleagues used real and synthetic blood samples to conduct seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric. By pumping blood onto a model at wound points shown on the shroud, researchers could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction depicted on the linen. They found bloodstains that were inconsistent with any single pose, which seems to suggest a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. If it was truly the death shroud of someone hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, “the bloodstains shouldn’t be so inconsistent.” BuzzFeed reports that researchers found forearm rivulets matched an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, for example, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees.

Instead of doing that you could have the best hotels in the world right there. Think of it from a real estate perspective, you have South Korea, you have China, and they own the land in the middle, how bad is that, right?

CNN shows a video clip of the two men approaching the limo, a Secret Service agent opening the door, and Kim peering in to take a look. \"We know that these men were trying to find ways to bond, in just like a personal, human way, and what's more natural for guys [than] to want to check out one another's car,\" Chris Cuomo notes.

He claimed to be worth $2.9 billion, but Forbes found that he was actually worth only$2.7 billion. Ross has also been accused of misleading investors and colleagues, resulting in millions of dollars in fines and lawsuits. Additionally, Ross failed to mention 19 suits in response to a questionnaire during his confirmation process. Ross' questionable assertions and recent controversy about a shipping company that does big business with close associates of Vladimir Putin paint a clearer picture of his tactics. Ross has been described as someone who is not afraid to bend the truth and has lied to many people. Ross' disappearance in 1990 and his subsequent appearance with Donald Trump at the announcement of a deal to recapitalize Trump's Taj Mahal casino are also discussed. Ross' career arc is examined, from his early days as a bankruptcy negotiator to his appointment as Commerce Secretary. Ross' former colleagues have expressed surprise at his decision to take the position, given the potential for him to have to reveal that he is not a billionaire. Ross' former colleagues have also raised questions about the $2 billion gift he allegedly transferred to his family members after the election. The gift has been described as a way for Ross to avoid disclosing his assets, but it has also raised questions about the potential for tax evasion. Ross' appointment of a billionaire to promote the country's economic growth has been defended by Donald Trump, who has said that he does not want poor people to hold economic roles in his administration. Trump has also said that Ross and White House economic adviser Gary Cohn \"had to give up a lot to take these jobs\" and that Cohn in particular \"went from massive pay days to peanuts\". Trump has also said that he does not want a poor person to hold the position of economic adviser. Trump has frequently touted himself as a champion of the \"forgotten men and women\" across the country, but his appointment of millionaires and billionaires to fill cabinet positions has been criticized. Trump has also been criticized for his resilience despite the cloud of investigations that has enveloped his administration and sent his poll numbers tumbling. Trump has held five rallies in the first five months in office, and his visit to a battleground state he captured in November has been turned into a celebration of his resilience.

The discovery came when Ross, 79, contacted Forbes in October to refute his ranking: Last year he was listed with a net worth of $2.9 billion on the Forbes 400; he claimed he was worth closer to $3.7 billion. Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague. When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"—and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

An official product shot of Kinect, formally known as Project Natal, the new motion-control system from Microsoft. The company showed it off Sunday night in a special performance in Los Angeles. After more than a year of speculation, we finally know what Microsoft's new motion-control system is called. For those that have referred to it for a year as Project Natal, meet Kinect for Xbox 360. On Sunday night, at the University of Southern California's Galen Center here, and during a special performance by Cirque du Soleil, Microsoft finally and formally pulled back the wraps on its much-anticipated system, now known as Kinect, but originally the work of the Israeli company 3DV. After sitting through (actually standing, as the press was placed on the floor of the arena for a couple of hours with no seats) the performance, in which the Cirque's performers acted out and demonstrated a number of ways that Kinect can be used, my first impression is that Microsoft has hit on something with some serious potential. But at least as demonstrated Sunday, that potential hasn't been fully realized. It was tempting to think that Microsoft was taking Kinect a little too seriously during the performance, given the scale and scope of the event (more on that in a bit), but it's clear that the company has a system on its hands that it plans to incorporate widely across its video gaming and digital living room environments. And while it's too soon to tell exactly how Kinect will be used, and what software is being developed for it--Microsoft will say a lot more Monday morning at its formal E3 press conference--one thing became clear Sunday night: with Kinect, and a sports game, and an exercise game for it, Microsoft is, among other things, putting Nintendo and its Wii, its Balance Board, its Wii Fit and Wii Sports squarely in its sights. After waiting in line for more than an hour, the thousands of people on hand for the Sunday night event were ushered inside the Galen Center. While we didn't know what was in store, we were first taken through mock living rooms, where \"normal\" American families greeted us.

The Tuaregs, like this man in Algeria, live in several different countries in North and West Africa. The very existence of the West African country of Mali is currently under threat. The whole of the north of the country is in the hands of a Tuareg rebellion, which nothing seems able to stop. President Amadou Toumani Touré was ousted on March 22 by a junta of captains calling themselves the National Council for the Recovery of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDRE). Taking advantage of the ensuing power vacuum in the capital Bamako, the rebels have gained possession of northern Mali at lightning speed. The rebels, the majority of whom are members of the nomadic Tuareg people, refuse to be called Malian, and they want to establish an independent Tuareg state called Azawad. Currently the rebels only hold the northern part of Mali, but with potential reinforcements arriving from other areas of the Sahel, a transition zone between the Sahara in the north and the savannahs to the south, and in particular from neighboring Niger, that could all change. In the meantime, the Malian army is falling apart. The captains who overthrew the president justified their actions by claiming to be working to end the decline of Mali. However, the coup has had precisely the opposite outcome. Despite the fall of city after city in the north over the past few days, the CNRDRE has not sent any troops north to defend the country from the rebels. West African leaders are responding quickly to try and avoid an outright collapse of the Malian state, and they have reacted with commendable promptness. At the impetus of, in particular, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, a diplomatic emergency committee has been formed that is threatening the junta with heavy sanctions if it does not relinquish power. However, none of the heads of states involved is entirely blameless. Some, like Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaoré, have faced mutinies in their own countries.

It was a black-and-white photograph in a newspaper. It showed a small boy, locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. His hands clutched what appeared to be chicken wire containing him, and his expression was agonised. There would be no Lumos – the charity dedicated to closing child institutions and so-called orphanages – if there hadn't first been this picture. I knew the immediate shameful impulse to turn away, to hide the page, not to look. I could try to justify that impulse by saying that I was pregnant at the time, feeling vulnerable and hormonal. The sad truth remains that my instinctive reaction to that picture could stand as a metaphor for the attitude that has enabled the unjustifiable incarceration of 8 million children around this world to take place with little outrage or comment. Ashamed of that reflexive refusal to look, I forced myself to turn back to the picture and read the article. It told of a nightmarish institution where children as young as six were caged most of the day and night. I ripped the article out, and the following day I began writing letters to everybody I could think of with influence in the matter. These efforts led quickly to the establishment of Lumos, named for the spell I created in Harry Potter to bring light to some dark and frightening places. Part of our work in Lumos is to shed light on the lives of those millions of children separated from their families for reasons of poverty, disability and discrimination. The shocking truth is that the vast majority of these children have parents that could care for them. They are not orphans. Most are placed in institutions by families who are too poor to provide for them, or because of a lack of local education and health facilities, especially for children with special needs. The minority who do not have parents, or for whom staying at home is not in their best interests, are often placed in institutions because there is no alternative. The idea of any child being taken from their family and locked away, all too often in atrocious conditions, is particularly poignant at this time of year. For children in institutions, life too often resembles the darkest of Grimms' fairytales. Georgette Mulheir, CEO of Lumos, tells how one Christmas she took sweets to the 270 children in a particular institution.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

{"pred": "    The news passages discuss the opposition to BP's executive pay package, which includes a 20% increase in Bob Dudley's total remuneration package for 2015. The opposition is based on the fact that BP lost $5.2 billion last year and is cutting thousands of jobs in response to falling oil prices. However, the author argues that managing an oil company when crude is trading at$100 per barrel is easy compared to the current environment, and that Dudley has to work harder than his predecessors. The author also notes that Dudley has delivered decent returns when compared to peers, and that his remuneration appears generous compared to other oil majors. The author concludes that Dudley's rewards look in line with the task of managing an oil company in the current environment.\n\nThe second news passage discusses the criticism of BP's executive pay package by a leading shareholder advisory group, Glass Lewis. The group has criticized the decision to award top directors their maximum bonuses for 2015, despite the company's lackluster performance. The group has recommended that shareholders vote against the payment plans. The author notes that the awards follow a year in which the company lost $5.2 billion as oil prices plummeted. The author also notes that the company's compensation committee awards executive bonuses based on the company's performance in a number of strategic areas, including safety and operational cash flow. The author concludes that the company's performance was excellent in 2015, and that the executive bonuses were fully earned. The third news passage discusses the shareholder rebellion against BP's executive pay package at the company's annual general meeting. The shareholders voted against the company's pay decisions for the first time in living memory, with 59% of proxy votes cast going against BP's decision to pay Mr Dudley nearly$20 million for 2015. The author notes that the rebellion highlighted a growing trend of institutional investors and advisers around the world taking a more aggressive stance over pay. The author also notes that the company has already paid Mr Dudley and other directors, and that the company defended the pay rise, saying that Dudley met or exceeded every one of the targets he was set. The author concludes that the company will review the terms on which pay is awarded in consultation with shareholders before next year.\n\nThe fourth news passage discusses the shareholder rejection of BP's executive pay package at the company's annual general meeting.

The company had indicated earlier in the day that it may also have to reduce its dividend, the Wall Street Journal reports. Dudley is set to receive the full bonus he was eligible for, which comes to $4.2 million (including $1.4 million in cash and a portion in deferred BP shares), per an earlier MarketWatch report. This amount was bumped up from the $3 million ($1 million in cash) he received in 2014. BP's CFO was also on the list to rake in his full bonus. \"We think it sends the wrong message,\" a rep for shareholder Royal London Asset Management tells the BBC. \"It shows that the board is out of touch.\" Not only did BP suffer straight-up monetary losses as the price of oil fell, it also announced it will be getting rid of about 7,000 jobs and taking other belt-tightening measures.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

It was needed, former Mayor Ed Murray once said, for a host of noble reasons: to reduce sugar consumption; to raise revenue for important projects like a year of “free” community college for all graduating public high school students; and, to subsidize purchases of healthy foods by low-income families. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seattle policymakers should have paid more attention to what happened in Cook County, Ill., which repealed its soda tax last year within two months after a tremendous public outcry. Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don’t raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer. Soda taxes don’t unite the city around some vague sense that everyone will be healthier—they unite diverse coalitions in opposition to them: Bernie Sanders and libertarians, labor unions, and businesses all come together to express strong opposition to these regressive, job-killing taxes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Seattle’s soda tax is particularly burdensome. A case of Gatorade that cost $15.99 on December 31, 2017 now costs $26.33, an increase of more than 64 percent. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Fortunately, business managers and customers are not stupid; retailers like Costco have posted signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where shoppers can buy the product without paying the massive tax. Already, there is evidence that people are voting with their feet and buying drinks in the suburbs, depriving Seattle of the revenue it claims to need. The same thing happened to Philadelphia when it implemented a soda tax.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The North Coast Journal included Martinez in a cover story featuring images of the 35 people listed as missing in Humboldt County on the California Department of Justice's website.

The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office said in a statement that Bekah's mother called deputies on November 18 and filed a missing person's report for her daughter. The mother told them she had last spoken to her daughter on November 12. Bekah told her mother that she was going to work on a marijuana farm and would see her in seven to eight days. Sheriff's officials said they followed \"all leads\" and the proper \"procedure\" to find Bekah. They also tried to contact Bekah and people who may know her, but were not successful. On December 12, Bekah's mother told officials she had heard from her daughter, who said she was on her way home. However, sheriff's officials said they were still unable to contact Bekah, and so did not take her off the missing persons list. The Humboldt 35 are all of the names on the California Attorney General's database of missing persons as of January 18.

{"pred": "    A Central California woman claims she was fired after uninstalling an app that her employer required her to run constantly on her company issued iPhone—an app that tracked her every move 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The app had a \"clock in/out\" feature which did not stop GPS monitoring, that function remained on. This is the problem about which Ms. Arias complained. Management never made mention of mileage. They would tell her co-workers and her of their driving speed, roads taken, and time spent at customer locations. Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time. A money-transfer company fired an employee for refusing to install an app that would track her location even when she was off the clock, the woman claims in court. The app enables employees to create electronic timecards on their phones to track when their shifts start, when they take breaks, and when a shift ends. The woman was one of the first employees asked to put the app on her phone. She researched the app and asked her boss if Intermex would be tracking her whereabouts when she was off the clock. Her boss admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments ever since she had installed the app on her phone. The woman expressed that she had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but she objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours and complained to her boss that this was an invasion of her privacy. She likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informed her boss that his actions were illegal. Her boss replied that she should tolerate the illegal intrusion because Intermex was paying her more than her previous employer. Her boss also told her she had to keep her phone on \"24/7\" to assist clients, and scolded her when she uninstalled the app to protect her privacy. The woman was fired a few weeks later. The employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a \"legitimate business interest\" to do so. But if an employee can't stop it, then that is a complete violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy. The woman objected to the app because there was no way to turn it off when she was at home. Even if she shut down the app on her phone, it would still be running in the background.

Now she's suing her former employer, money transfer service Intermex, for invasion of privacy, unfair business practices, and retaliation, among other things, Ars Technica reports. Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called. Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

The woman was a disgruntled employee who showed up for work at her normal time at the facility near Aberdeen. She shot people outside the building and on the warehouse floor. The woman died at a nearby hospital after shooting herself in the head. The suspect was identified as Snochia Moseley, 26, from Baltimore County. Police are still searching for a motive. The suspect used a 9 mm Glock pistol and brought several magazines for the gun. The gun was hers and was purchased legally. The sheriff wouldn't release any details about the six victims or the shooter, saying that their next of kin were still being notified. No law enforcement officers fired shots during their response. Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center received four patients with \"priority one gunshot wounds.\" Two of the victims were stable and doing well, while two remain seriously injured. All the victims were out of surgery. Rite Aid spokeswoman Susan Henderson said roughly 1,000 employees work at the distribution center, where products are received and processed for delivery. The shooting happened adjacent to the primary building. A neighbor said she was waiting on the bus when someone told her there had been a shooting nearby. She saw emergency vehicles, including ambulances, and helicopters, which were out of place for the \"sleepy\" part of the county. The area is home to many warehouses and plants, some belonging to major brands, including makeup and bleach companies. It's the third high-profile shooting in the US in two days.

Speaking under an umbrella in pouring rain, Mr. Cosby’s publicist, Andrew Wyatt, said his client’s defeat was part of the “sex war” happening in Washington, comparing it to accusations of sexual misconduct against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh that are roiling the capital. Mr. Wyatt said that Mr. Cosby, once a beloved actor and comedian, had endured the “most racist and sexist trial” in the country’s history. On Tuesday, Mr. Cosby, 81, was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, Andrea Constand, at his home outside Philadelphia in 2004. Judge Steven T. O’Neill also ruled that Mr. Cosby qualified as a “sexually violent predator” under state law. Shortly after Bill Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in state prison for sexual assault and taken away in handcuffs, his spokesperson Andrew Wyatt told reporters that Cosby — along with embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh — was the victim of a “sex war.” “What is going on in Washington today with Judge Kavanaugh is part of that sex war that Judge [Steven] O’Neill and his wife are a part of,” Wyatt said, referring to the judge who oversaw Cosby’s trial.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The probe will have to withstand heat and radiation never before experienced by any spacecraft, but the specially designed mission will also address questions that couldn't be answered before. Understanding the sun in greater detail can also shed light on Earth and its place in the solar system, researchers said. The mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The Parker Solar Probe will eventually orbit within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface. The observations and data could provide insight about the physics of stars, change what we know about the mysterious corona, increase understanding of solar wind, and help improve forecasting of major space weather events. Those events can impact satellites and astronauts as well as the Earth -- including the power grid and radiation exposure on airline flights. The mission is scheduled to end in June 2025. The Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying whatever inscription Parker wishes to provide -- his message to the sun. The probe will eventually be closer to the sun than Mercury. It will be close enough to watch solar wind whip up from subsonic to supersonic. The probe's 4½-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shields will have to withstand temperatures close to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to its design, the inside of the spacecraft and its instruments will remain at a comfortable room temperature. The probe will reach a speed of 450,000 mph around the sun.

The report offers some of the first details to emerge about the source of the attack that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts and 70 million customer records. The investigation found that the attack was carried out by a group of hackers from Eastern Europe, who used sophisticated malware to steal customer data from the point-of-sale systems of several major retailers, including Target, Neiman Marcus, and Home Depot. The hackers were able to bypass security measures and steal customer data, including credit card numbers, names, and addresses, without being detected.

Over the last year, the Committee queried nine of the major data companies and invited testimony from privacy groups. What's emerged is that collectively, these companies own an astounding number of consumer profiles, and they're selling deeply personal information — sometimes to identity thieves — in categories like rape victims, people with cancer, and \"Rural and Barely Making It.\" One data broker is selling lists of addresses and names of consumers suffering from conditions including cancer, diabetes, and depression, and the medications used for those conditions; another is offering lists naming consumers, their credit scores, and specific health conditions. Of the nine companies the Committee approached — Acxiom, Experian, Epsilon, Reed Elsevier, Equifax, TransUnion, Rapleaf, Spokeo, and Datalogix — \"some\" were forthcoming. The report mentions Equifax as being particularly cooperative. Others weren't. Acxiom, which according to the report has \"multi-sourced insight into approximately 700 million consumers worldwide,\" Experian, and Epsilon refused to explain how they collected their data or who they were selling it to, citing confidentiality clauses in their contracts. (The Attorney General of New Jersey recently released documents indicating Acxiom sold another company, Dataium, 400,000 dossiers for a mere $2,500.) In October, Experian admitted that it sold personal information — including social security numbers and banking information — through a subsidiary to an alleged online identity theft ring.

The researchers who made the discovery base their findings on mathematical and computer modeling, and anticipate its discovery via telescope within five years. The researchers insist there will be no Pluto-style planetary debate once the planet is detected. The discovery of a ninth planet has renewed calls for Pluto to be reinstated into the club of planets from which it was unceremoniously dumped in 2006. However, the researchers who made the discovery argue that those arguing for its reinstatement should stop living in the past and embrace the reality that it is not a planet. They argue that the New Horizons mission would be far better off excited about the fact that they are going to a new type of object in the outer Solar System. The researchers also argue that had the International Astronomical Union decided to keep Pluto as a planet and enroll Eris, it would eventually find itself having to consider the candidacies of hundreds, possibly thousands of wannabe planets. The researchers insist that there is no other way of categorizing our Solar System than to describe it as having eight dominant objects in it which are the planets we know. They argue that it is really no good keeping Pluto and classifying it as one of the major objects because it is just not.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

Presidential historians tell the AP that no president, including Nixon during the Watergate scandal, has publicly turned on the press the way Trump did. \"It was bizarre theater,\" says Rice University history professor Douglas Brinkley. \"He turned a presidential press conference into a reality-TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.\" GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alice Stewart also found a few things to praise in Trump's performance. \"You can't say he's not responsive to the press,\" she tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \"He answered all the questions from all over the press corps and put to rest the long-standing dialogue that he shuts down certain news outlets.\" Vox lists nine moments that it suggests back up Jake Tapper's description of the press conference as \"wild\" and \"unhinged,\" including Trump's claim that \"the leaks are real\" but \"the news is fake.\" Late-night hosts approached the press conference as gleefully as a kid unwrapping Christmas presents, and the Washington Post rounds up some of their best lines. \"My guess is he did it because he's mad and he just wanted to blow off some steam,\" Jimmy Kimmel said. \"The tone of the press conference was like if your dad found a pack of cigarettes under your mattress.\" David Graham at the Atlantic looks at the continual theme of complaint in the conference and wonders: Does Trump hate his new job?"], "all_classes": null, "length": 10933}

The lawmaker told CNN Tuesday it was unclear when the movement was detected, what the direction of the projectile was and how it was being transported. He attended the briefing by South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) in Seoul on Monday. All eyes have been on North Korea following the country's sixth test of a nuclear weapon Sunday. Seismological data indicated the weapon was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation, nuclear experts said. North Korean state media claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear weapon, which could be fitted atop a long-range missile capable of striking the United States. Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM. The country has test-fired a number of missiles this summer, including two long-range ones in July and an intermediate-range one in August that overflew the Japanese island of Hokkaido. A South Korean lawmaker who attended the briefing said the NIS said North Korea may test-fire an ICBM towards the North Pacific at a lower angle than the two tests in July, which were lofted, meaning they flew higher but not as far. South Korea's Navy conducted a live-fire drill in the waters off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korea's Sunday nuclear test. While South Korean forces have flexed their muscles, diplomats in New York gathered at the United Nations and condemned the nuclear test. Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday the United States would circulate a resolution in response after urging her colleagues to adopt the strongest sanctions measures possible to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program. Another lawmaker who attended the Monday briefing, Lee Cheol-woo, told reporters the NIS informed them that Pyongyang had dug extra tunnels at the nuclear test site and could explode another one \"anytime.\" South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his American counterpart, President Donald Trump, spoke by phone Monday and agreed to lift current restrictions on the payload weight of South Korea's ballistic missiles.

But Reuters does pick up some alleged details on those fronts, via an unnamed source quoted by South Korea’s Asia Business Daily. Its source says the ICBM started moving Monday, is only being moved at night, and is headed toward the nation's west coast. Reuters notes there's some likelihood that another test could come on or around Saturday: Sept. 9 is the country's founding day holiday. CNBC notes North Korea conducted a nuke test on Sept. 9, 2016. Two more details that allegedly came from the South's National Intelligence Service briefing: word that additional tunnels have been dug out at the North's nuclear test site that would facilitate future detonations, and suspicions that the next ICBM test firing might be directed toward the North Pacific but aimed at a lower angle, which would in theory allow it to fly further than previous tests, which had more of an upward trajectory. Meanwhile, the White House tells Reuters it has given \"in-principle approval\" to a request by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to abolish a limit regarding warhead weights, a move that would strengthen the power with which it could attack the North, if necessary.

But investigators haven't been able to locate a gun despite the use of a helicopter and dive team. Salazar says they have found a pipe with Jones' blood on it near the scene of the shooting.

The study found that one in seven colon cancer patients is under 50, and younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer. However, they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively. The researchers suggest that doctors should be on the lookout for warning signs of colon cancer, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a blockage in the colon. They also recommend that people with a family history of colon cancer and others at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50. The study raises the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age, but the researchers caution that more research is needed before any changes are made.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

{"pred": "    Humans arrived in the arid interior of Australia some 10,000 years earlier than we thought, archaeologists suggest, with the discovery of ancient artefacts in a South Australian cave that have been dated to as far back as 49,000 years ago. The site, which is a newly discovered cave in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, is known as the Warratyi rock-shelter. Archaeologist Giles Hamm from La Trobe University in Melbourne led the excavations at the cave, finding what appear to be some of the oldest bone and quartz tools ever found in Australia, plus the earliest known use of the pigment ochre in the country’s history. Artefacts that have been found so far include burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre and gypsum pigments, and the team says this is evidence that these early technologies were developed locally. The old idea is that people might have come from the East, from the Levant, out of Africa, and these modern humans may have come with a package of innovative technologies. But the development of these fine stone tools, the bone technology, we think that happened as a local innovation, due to a local cultural evolution. That’s significant, adds one of the team, Gavin Prideaux from Flinders University in Adelaide, because it challenges certain assumptions that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in on the globe. There is a Eurocentric view that material culture in Australia is quite simplistic and backward, but this helps rewrite that story. Until now, the oldest human tool found in Australia’s vast, arid interior has been a tiny axe fragment found earlier this year in the Carpenter's Gap rock-shelter of the Kimberley region of northwest Australia. While the Carpenter’s Gap site is not far from the northwest coast of Australia - thought to be one of the earliest settled parts of Australia - the Warratyi rock-shelter sits more than 2,000 km from the early settlement of Lake Mungo in southeasten New South Wales, making it a much more difficult trek. The tools have been dated based on a couple of estimates - quartz grains from the site have been dated to 44,000 years ago, but radiocarbon dating of the burnt eggshells, which are thought to be evidence of human cooking, revealed them to be between 45,000 and 49,000 years old.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

He became a journalism instructor at Red River College in 2002 and resigned in 2011. Police released this still image from surveillance video of a man they say robbed two banks in Medicine Hat, Alta.

After spending 24 years together, Vogelsang and his wife separated in 2015 and he moved back to Winnipeg. She filed for divorce last summer. According to court documents, Vogelsang and his wife had owned three properties in Nelson and sold them for a total loss of $85,000. Vogelsang was supposed to take over fully last September after removing his ex-wife's name from the paperwork.

NEWLINE_CHAR Dramatic shifts in the East African climate may have driven toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives by the Middle Stone Age, roughly 320,000 years ago. That’s the implication of discoveries reported in three papers published online March 15 in Science. NEWLINE_CHAR At roughly 320,000 years old, the excavated Middle Stone Age tools are the oldest of their kind, paleoanthropologist Rick Potts and colleagues report in one of the new papers. Researchers had previously estimated that such tools — spearpoints and other small implements struck from prepared chunks of stone — date to no earlier than 280,000 to possibly 300,000 years ago. Other more primitive, handheld cutting stones made of local rock date from around 1.2 million to 499,000 years ago at Olorgesailie. Gradual downsizing of those tools, including oval hand axes, occurred from 615,000 to 499,000 years ago, a stretch characterized by frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions, the scientists say. NEWLINE_CHAR It’s not known whether that tool trend continued or if a sudden transition to Middle Stone Age implements happened between 499,000 and 320,000 years ago. Erosion at Olorgesailie artifact sites has destroyed sediment from that time period, leaving the nature of toolmaking during that time gap a mystery. Age estimates relied on measures of the decay of radioactive forms of argon and uranium in volcanic ash layers framing tool-bearing sediment. It’s unclear whether Homo sapiens or a closely related species made Olorgesailie’s Middle Stone Age tools, since no hominid fossils have been found there. NEWLINE_CHAR Back-and-forth shifts from dry to wet conditions — many happening over only a few years or decades — continued to regularly reshape the Olorgesailie landscape around 320,000 years ago, conclude Potts, of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and colleagues in another of the new papers. That timing coincides roughly with the emergence of H. sapiens (SN: 12/23/17, p. 24).

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Elite and other priority passengers in group 1 and 2 will load through lane 1, while customers in group 3, 4 and 5 will use lane 2. Those not actively boarding will be asked to remain seated until paged. Chase co-branded credit card holders will board in group 2. In addition to the new boarding process, United is also launching push notifications for those who have the airline's mobile app. Those who opt in will be given a push notification when boarding starts, which will be particularly useful if a flight is delayed or if the ground crew decides to load the aircraft early. This week's updates come as the latest milestone in a long history of experimentation that United and other airlines have performed around the oft-complicated and congested boarding process. Some of United's peers are already using this simplified process, but one difference between United and its competitors is that top tier or \"1K\" elite members will be able to pre-board before the official process starts.

Some 50 demonstrators on Thursday held a protest outside the offices of Homrich, a company contracted by the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) to stop the flow to residences at least two months past due on their accounts. At least nine of the activists were arrested by Detroit police and charged with disorderly conduct when they temporarily blocked trucks from leaving the company’s parking lot. While the protest was relatively small, activists say it’s a sign of things to come if DWSD continues shutting off water lines. The activists say that in a city with a poverty rate of 44 percent, and where water bills are higher than in much of the country, Detroit should work out a solution with poor residents instead of leaving them dry. Otherwise, they say, they’ll have no other choice but to take to the streets. Critics say that DWSD has been unnecessarily aggressive in pursuing delinquent accounts since it began ramping up shutoffs in April. Williams said the department has shut off accounts of families with young children, as well as houses with the disabled and elderly residents. The water department says it needs to shut off the water to recoup some $175 million in outstanding bills. But DWSD has also been accused of ignoring the debts of large entities — like a golf course that owes $437,000 and the state of Michigan itself, which owes $70,000 — while going after people who owe as little as $150 on their accounts. Activists say those high numbers give residents no choice but to protest. Last month, Detroit activists successfully petitioned a U.N. panel to call the water shutoffs a violation of human rights. Earlier this week, a group from Windsor, Ontario, crossed the border to deliver 1,000 liters of water in a display of support for Detroit residents. And protests have been held outside DWSD’s offices every Friday since the shutoffs began. The pressure seems to be partially working: DWSD announced a $1 million fund on Tuesday for residents struggling to pay. But even with the $1 million, activists say many others are likely to lose access to water over the summer. If the shutoffs continue, they say, DWSD can expect larger protests.

Russia's intervention in Ukraine has led to Canada all but severing relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin as well as imposing a slew of sanctions against individuals and entities in both countries.

A man with Katriuk's name lay in wait in March 1943 outside a barn that had been set ablaze, operating a machine-gun and firing on civilians as they tried to flee the burning building. The same document said the man took a watch, bracelet and gun from the body of a woman found nearby. \"One witness stated that Katriuk was a particularly active participant in the atrocity: he reportedly lay behind the stationary machine-gun, firing rounds on anyone attempting to escape the flames,\" the study by Lund University historian Per Anders Rudling says. Katriuk allegedly deserted his SS unit when it moved to France from eastern Europe in 1944. He lived in Paris before moving to Canada in 1951, according to court documents. He later became a Canadian citizen and lived with his French-born wife in Ontario, working as a beekeeper.

The Chimerix pharmaceutical company said Tuesday that the ailing 7-year-old will receive medicine that doctors hope will help him when he becomes the first patient in a new trial set to start Wednesday. Todd Hardy, Josh's father, said he got the call from Chimerix president Kenneth Moch about a half hour before the public announcement was made. \"It was wonderful,\" Hardy said. \"Truly wonderful. It was overwhelming.\" In an emotional Facebook post, mother Aimee Hardy praised the company's decision. \"Glory to GOD!\" she wrote. \"They are releasing the drug for Josh!!!!!!!!!\" The company had previously denied calls from the 7-year-old's family to give him the drug, brincidofovir, arguing that spending the time to help Josh and others like him would slow down efforts to get the drug on the market. Josh's story drew national attention as his parents and supporters pushed the company to change its mind in online and media campaigns. CNN told Josh's story Sunday night, describing his parents' desperate pleas for help from Chimerix. Josh's journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung, and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it. But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body. Now he's in critical condition in an intensive care unit as the virus ravages his body. Josh is in heart and kidney failure. He vomits blood several times an hour as his family gathers in vigil. His doctors at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis had also been pushing for the company to provide the drug. In a statement Tuesday, the hospital said it expected to receive the medication within 48 hours, but noted that its safety and effectiveness has not yet been established for use in children. \"It is also important to understand that this remains a critical and complex medical situation,\" the hospital said. \"St. Jude will continue to pursue state-of-the-art treatment for Josh and all of our patients.

The Hollywood Reporter recounts how Sizemore was told to leave the set after the child actress told her mother that he had touched her genitals during a photo shoot. The incident has previously gone unreported, but is coming out now in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment-and-rape scandal. Sizemore has never been accused of molestation before, but is notorious in Hollywood for his drug use and convictions for battery against women. Despite his rap sheet, he has worked steadily in the industry. The young actress, now 26, is unidentified at her request; she told THR she didn't want to talk about the matter except to say that she's recently hired a lawyer to explore legal action against the actor as well as her parents. Sizemore is said to have denied the young actress' claim as soon as he was confronted with it; shortly after, he was quietly dropped by his management firm and talent agency. The promotional photo session required the child to be seated on Sizemore's lap for a holiday picture. The paper also interviewed Robyn Adamson, who portrayed the wife in the film, who stood near the photographer when the picture was being taken. She recalled the child, who was wearing a flannel nightgown, reacting to something during the photoshoot. When casting director Catrine McGregor heard about the alleged encounter from the child's agent, she filed a complaint with the Screen Actors Guild legal department and pushed for Sizemore's immediate dismissal from the project. The paper also talked to a production assistant, Roi Maufas, who said the crew believed what the child said because they considered Sizemore a \"sleazebag.\" The producers of the film told THR they removed Sizemore from the set as soon as they heard about the assertion, reviewed the photographs from the portrait session but found them to be inconclusive, and suggested to the child's parents they could contact police if they wanted. The incident has never been revealed publicly. Sizemore, 55, already notorious in Hollywood for his drug use and convictions for battery against women, has never been accused of molestation before.

They say the day after a Born Killers scene in which the girl sat on Sizemore's lap, she told her parents that he had touched her inappropriately, possibly putting his finger inside her. \"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited. I was watching her,\" co-star Robyn Adamson says. \"Later, when I was told about what happened, I knew exactly what it was.\" \"There was never any doubt. He was this guy who was already known for making inappropriate comments, being drunk, being high,\" says production assistant Roi Maufas. \"Then this happens. Guys reached for hammers,\" he says. Producers say Sizemore, who was ordered to leave the set, denied the allegations. Crew members say the girl's parents spoke to police, but ended up not pressing charges, possibly out of fear of ruining her film career.

{"pred": "    When Linda Hooper met her son, Cruz, in the fall of 1981, she loathed him. A veteran elementary teacher, Hooper's conscience told her it was wrong to hate a child, especially a student. But Cruz Riojas' tendency toward frequent, violent outbursts made it difficult for Hooper to think of him as anything other than a \"holy terror.\" In the 33 years following that school year at Brown Elementary School, however, Riojas would not only change Hooper's opinion of him forever - he would also change his last name. Infamous classroom legend \"There evidently is a very thin line between love and hate,\" Hooper said during an hourlong interview at her home last week. Cruz, who lives in San Antonio, was in West Texas visiting family for the Fourth of July weekend. It's a long, emotional story of how teacher and pupil became mother and son, and one they chose to tell for the first time in almost 35 years. \"What had happened was for like about five years before I got him, I was warned, 'You don't want that child,' because he was really a holy terror,\" Hooper, 68, said. \"He had a reputation, and he intended to live up to it.\" Sometimes Cruz misbehaved, using his still-prevalent sense of dry humor to distract the class from the teacher's lesson. Other times, he threw chairs or stabbed his peers. His academic standing made for an extra challenge. He had dyslexia and was two grade levels behind in reading, so he was considered a special education student. By the time Cruz reached sixth grade, he had become a Brown Elementary legend. His notorious antics led Hooper to tell her principal, \"If you put that Riojas kid in my class, I'm going to quit.\" Though she never made good on that promise, Hooper said she wasn't joking. \"I really had hoped that he'd be put in another person's room, but at that time I was the only one who could really handle the hard discipline problems,\" she said. Total squalor Cruz, now 45, said when he was growing up he did anything to get attention. The violence stemmed from a constant need to defend himself at home.

But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated. More than a decade later, he was still part of the Hooper family—but he wanted to make it official by asking the Hoopers to adopt him right before his 30th birthday. “He said he wanted to honor us, and it was a big honor,\" Hooper tells Today. \"I’ve always known he loved me, but this really showed he loved us.” The adoption went through in 1998, but Cruz \"was my son from the day I kept him,” Hooper says.

He died on Friday at age 94. His wife of more than 70 years, Barbara, died at the age of 92 earlier this year. Mr. Bush was the last American president to serve in World War II, a fight that helped shape his life and the lives of many in his generation. He went on to build a sterling resume—businessman, member of Congress, envoy to the United Nations and China, head of the Central Intelligence Agency—before becoming Republican Ronald Reagan’s vice president in 1980 and then succeeding him in the White House in the election in 1988. He lost his bid for re-election to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, after a campaign in which he was hampered by two years of disappointing economic performance and an insurrection among his own party’s conservatives over a decision to raise taxes. The loss was a bitter personal disappointment, but one he handled with the kind of grace that allowed him to become friends with Mr. Clinton in later life. In subsequent years, historians have been far kinder regarding the Bush presidency than were voters at the time. Mr. Bush also won some degree of vindication when his eldest son, George W. Bush, won the White House in 2000, making Mr. Bush the only American since John Adams to be both a president and father of a president. George H.W. Bush was born June 12, 1924, in Milton, Mass. His father, Prescott Bush, was a successful Wall Street executive and, later, a U.S. senator from Connecticut. The son appeared set to follow his father’s steps from elite prep school to Yale and on to a career in the financial industry when World War II broke out. The younger Mr. Bush joined the Navy and, when sworn in on his 18th birthday, became its youngest pilot. He flew 58 missions in the Pacific, piloting an Avenger torpedo bomber—with his girlfriend Barbara’s name painted on its side—from an aircraft carrier. He was shot down and was rescued by a submarine, a rescue captured in what became a famous bit of grainy film footage. Two other crewmen died; Mr. Bush was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

However, he was later convicted for entirely different crimes and is currently serving a prison sentence. In anticipation of his parole hearing, let's take a look at O.J. Simpson's net worth, as well as revisit his infamous murder trial. Despite being acquitted in the criminal case, he was found guilty in a subsequent civil suit and ordered to pay $33.5 million to the Brown and Goldman families. He also defaulted on the mortgage of his estate and the property went into foreclosure. O.J. Simpson's football career is nothing short of legendary. He was a Heisman Trophy winner and a member of the University of Southern California football team. He was chosen by the Buffalo Bills as the first pick in the 1969 NFL draft and played for the team for nine seasons. In 1973, he made history as the first NFL player to rush more than 2,000 yards in a season. After retiring from the NFL, he became an actor and appeared in nearly three dozen films and television shows. In June 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman were found stabbed to death outside her Brentwood condominium. Days later, O.J. Simpson was charged with the murders. After promising to turn himself in, he famously led police on a 60-mile low-speed chase in a white Ford Bronco. The trial ran from January 24, 1995 to October 2, 1995 and was regarded as the trial of the century. Judge Lance A. Ito allowed cameras in the courtroom, granting the public a front row seat. Some 150 million viewers tuned in to watch the reading of the not-guilty verdict, making it one of the most watched events in history. The country is still divided regarding the O.J. Simpson trial and verdict today. In September 2007, O.J. Simpson and five other men forced their way into sports memorabilia collector Bruce Fromong's Las Vegas hotel room and robbed him at gunpoint. Simpson said he was trying to reclaim personal items stolen from his home years ago. The guilty verdict in this O.J. Simpson court case came on the 13th anniversary of his double murder acquittal.

{"pred": "    Jamaican lawmakers have passed an act to decriminalise small amounts of marijuana and establish a licensing agency to regulate a lawful medical cannabis industry on the island. The law makes possession of up to 2oz (56.6g) of marijuana a petty offence that would not result in a criminal record. Cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises would be permitted in Jamaica, where the drug has long been culturally entrenched but illegal. The law paves the way for a licensing authority to be set up to deal with regulations on cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific and therapeutic purposes. Rastafarians can also legally use marijuana for religious purposes for the first time on the island where the spiritual movement was founded in the 1930s. Tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad will be able to apply for permits at a cost authorising them to legally buy small amounts of \"ganja\", as it is known locally. Peter Bunting, the island's national security minister, said the Jamaican government did not plan to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. The passage of this legislation does not create a free-for-all in the growing, transporting, dealing or exporting of ganja. The security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with our international treaty obligations. William Brownfield, the US assistant secretary for counter-narcotics affairs, said before the vote that \"Jamaican law is of course Jamaica's own business and Jamaica's sovereign decision\". But he noted that the trafficking of marijuana into the US remains illegal. We expect that Jamaica and all states party to the UN drug conventions will uphold their obligations, including a firm commitment to combating and dismantling criminal organisations involved in drug trafficking. For decades debate has raged in Jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting ganja. Previous efforts to decriminalise small amounts have been scuttled because officials feared they would violate international treaties and bring sanctions from Washington. But after changes in other countries, Jamaican officials hope the island could become a player in the nascent medical marijuana industry, health tourism and the development of innovative pot-derived items. Local scientists already have a history of creating marijuana-derived products, such as \"Canasol\", which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients. On Tuesday the Jamaican commerce minister, Anthony Hylton, said the industry held \"great potential\" for Jamaica, which is labouring under its latest loan programme with the International Monetary Fund.

A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement.

It prevents the King from simply locking up subjects in secret dungeons and throwing away the key. The Founders of our nation believed habeas corpus was so essential to preserving liberty, justice, and democracy that they enshrined it in the very first article of the United States Constitution. However, in its waning days, the last Congress passed the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006, which revoked the right to habeas corpus for anyone detained at Guantánamo Bay as well as for any foreigner the government detains anywhere and labels an \"enemy combatant.\" This provision applies to legal residents of the U.S. as well, meaning someone who has lived in the U.S. for years could potentially be labeled an \"enemy combatant\" and then thrown into prison with no legal recourse to challenge their detention. The government has little or no evidence against most of the men detained at Guantánamo. We now know that almost none of the Guantánamo prisoners were taken into custody by U.S. forces or captured on any battlefield. The overwhelming majority were sold into captivity by Northern Alliance and Pakistani warlords for substantial bounties. In fact, of the nearly 800 men that have been held at Guantánamo, only 10 have ever been charged with any crime. Soon after the first 20 detainees were flown to Guantánamo, CCR began filing habeas corpus petitions asking the government to explain why it was holding these men outside of the reach of the U.S. court system in what has since become a notorious offshore penal colony. Despite numerous legal victories that affirm the detainees' right to challenge their detention, the Bush administration has managed to prevent the detainees from getting a fair hearing in the courts. In June 2007, the Supreme Court decided to hear CCR's most recent case challenging the detention of many Guantanamo detainees. These men have faced indefinite detention, sham trials, and conditions rapidly inducing psychological deterioration for nearly six years.

Last week federal marshals raided the Gibson Guitar Corporation in Tennessee. It wasn't the first time. The government appears to be preparing to charge the famous builder of instruments with trafficking in illegally obtained wood. It's a rare collision of music and environmental regulation. In the hottest part of an August Tennessee day last Thursday, Gibson Guitar CEO Henry Juszkiewicz stood out in the full sun for 30 minutes and vented to the press about the events of the day before. We had a raid, he said, with federal marshals that were armed, that came in, evacuated our factory, shut down production, sent our employees home and confiscated wood. The raids at two Nashville facilities and one in Memphis recalled a similar raid in Nashville in November 2009, when agents seized a shipment of ebony from Madagascar. They were enforcing the Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law that was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals. But Juszkiewicz says the government won't tell him exactly how — or if — his company has violated that law. We're in this really incredible situation. We have been implicated in wrongdoing and we haven't been charged with anything, he says. Our business has been injured to millions of dollars. And we don't even have a court we can go to and say, Look, here's our position. The U.S. Justice Department won't comment about the case it's preparing, but a court motion filed in June asserts Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband. It quotes emails that seem to show Gibson taking steps to maintain a supply chain that's been connected to illegal timber harvests. Andrea Johnson, director of forest programs for the Environmental Investigation Agency in Washington, says the Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. EIA's independent investigations have concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood. Gibson clearly understood the risks involved, says Johnson. Was on the ground in Madagascar getting a tour to understand whether they could possibly source illegally from that country. And made a decision in the end that they were going to source despite knowing that there was a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood. Gibson vigorously denies these allegations, maintaining that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week. NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 1352}

{"pred": "        The news articles discuss the discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars that covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of the planet. The ocean was a mile deep in places and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water. The discovery adds to the emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, which trickled with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes. The view of the planet's ancient history radically re-writes what many scientists believed only a decade ago. The scientists used infrared telescopes to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years, showing that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium. The high concentration of deuterium means that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters. But Mars was probably never completely submerged. Based on the Martian terrain today, the scientists believe the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface. The Atlantic, by comparison, covers about 17% of Earth's surface. The huge body of water lasted for millions of years, but over time, the Martian atmosphere thinned, and the planet lost much of its insulation. The ocean receded and eventually froze, leaving only 13% of the ocean locked up in the Martian polar caps. The discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars adds to the growing evidence that Mars was once a warm and wet world with standing water for 1.5 billion years, longer than it took for life to emerge on Earth. The search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its Exomars rover to the red planet. The rover will look for chemical signatures of life, perhaps emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil. Last year, NASA's Curiosity rover detected methane in the Martian atmosphere, sparking intense speculation that the gas might be coming from living organisms. However, there is no evidence to suggest it is. Methane is regularly produced on planets through geological processes without any need for life.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The European Court of Justice has sent the case back to the EU’s trademark office, which must review a 2012 decision to uphold Nestle’s trademark on the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit. Mondelez has appealed against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016 that found the EUIPO was wrong to reject its complaint.

{"pred": "    The T. rex's roar has struck fear into audiences from the days of King Kong to Jurassic World, but new research found that dinosaurs probably didn't sound anything like that. The roar of \"Jurassic Park\" is a witches' brew of baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs and a gargling alligator, remixed into a cinematically terrifying but completely artificial aural blast. Were a dinosaur to vocalize in defense of its territory — or as a mating call — it might have sounded like one of today's birds, scientists say. In fact, a journal article published online Monday argues that the ancient reptiles made sounds closer to the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich. Those are far cries from mammalian screams. According to the new research, dino sounds may be what scientists call \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" Unlike the high-pitched chirps and tweets from the open beaks of songbirds, the closed-mouth sounds are low, throaty whooshes of air. A flesh sac called an esophageal pouch enables birds with proportionally large bodies — think pigeons or doves — to produce the low murmurs. The researchers figured out the common bird sound like this: First, they collected vocal data on all sorts of animals called archosaurs, which include birds and crocodiles. And, notably, the long-dead dinosaurs. Writing in the journal Evolution, scientists from universities in Texas, Arizona, Utah and Canada analyzed the noises made by many living bird and crocodilian species. They divided the types of sounds into various groups, including the close-mouth noises. Roughly a quarter of 200 birds species analyzed emitted the bulging closed-mouth sounds. Small birds, like sparrows and finches, did not make the noise. But birds with proportionally larger body types — like doves, ostriches and the giant New Zealand cassowary — do. This, the researchers say, suggest large-bodied dinosaurs may have had similar vocal abilities. Moreover, because not all birds had the trait, the scientists say it evolved separately in different groups of animals. It appeared in 16 distinct animal lineages, including crocodiles and birds. The scientists feel confident it could have evolved in dinosaurs, too. The researchers were handicapped in their study because vocal organs, made of soft tissue, do not fossilize the way dinosaur bones do. So it's much easier to build a big scary creature than to reconstruct what it sounded like. But there are a few other hints", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

Under the agreement, Vanderbilt will pay$1.2 million, the equivalent of the gift made 83 years ago, to the organization's Tennessee chapter. In exchange, the chapter will relinquish its naming rights to the building.

About 30 miles to the southeast, Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro wants to remove the name of Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings. The public higher education system overseeing the school endorsed the change last month, but the proposal faces a tougher hurdle when it reaches the Tennessee Historical Commission. Under the \"Tennessee Heritage Protection Act\" passed earlier this year, it now takes a vote of at least two-thirds of the commission to approve changing or removing historical markers.

His lawyers argue that the trial should have been held outside of Boston because of the widespread outrage over the attack and the difficulty of finding impartial jurors. They also argue that the definition of a \"crime of violence\" is too vague and that many convictions are being thrown into question. Tsarnaev apologized at his sentencing. Attorneys for Tsarnaev appealed his conviction and death sentence, arguing that publicity made it impossible for him to get a fair trial in Boston and that capital punishment is unconstitutional. They cite a recent dissent by a Supreme Court justice that the death penalty may now be unconstitutional. Tsarnaev was sentenced to death in June for helping his older brother carry out the bombing. The appeal claims that \"continuous and unrelenting publicity\" about the bombings, the defendant, and his family prevented him from getting an impartial hearing. The defense repeatedly asked for a change of venue before the trial began, but the requests were rejected by the judge. Despite the dramatic news from court, the Boston Marathon bomber's fate will take years to reach its conclusion. Only three of 340 prisoners sentenced to federal death row have been executed in the last 50 years. Tsarnaev will join the rare group of men and women awaiting execution on federal death row. His fate will take years to reach its conclusion as his legal team appeals his conviction and sentence. The Justice Department could attempt to fast-track executions in the name of public interest, but death penalty experts expect the very quickest timeframe from Friday's sentence to Tsarnaev actually being put on a gurney and injected with lethal chemicals would be at least 10 years. The prisoner's team of legal defenders have already indicated two strong lines of likely appeal: that on prejudicial grounds the trial should never have been held in Boston where the bombings happened; and that the defense was given insufficient time to mount a full argument in mitigation that might have convinced the jury to spare Tsarnaev from the federal death chamber. Most capital cases in the US are handled by individual death penalty states, mainly in the deep south, while the involvement of the federal government in America's most controversial judicial practice has become increasingly unusual in modern times.

The trial delay comes as Washington and other powers are trying to prod Tehran to return to talks about its nuclear activities.

The State Department has never suggested the version published by WikiLeaks, always maintaining that it did not know how their arrest happened. The hikers were hiking in Kurdistan, a region of northern Iraq, and had no idea they were near the border. They encountered Kurdish pesh merga soldiers who greeted them warmly, but were arrested by Iranian guards after hiking too far. The hikers were extremely unlucky and made one mistake: hiking too far.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR PS4 lead system architect Mark Cerny talked about how the evolution of the PS4 came about, saying it began five years ago, earlier on in the life of the PS3. The PS3 was a first step, which was designed to connect to a variety of services, but it was limited because of how early it launched in that world, Cerny said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “Much less value is found today in blast processing or a system-on-a-chip,” Cerny said. He suggested tech could interfere with design innovation. The tech remains important, he stressed, but the idea was to create a platform that was all about experience. Sound familiar? That’s because it’s a tune Apple and Steve Jobs started playing years ago when they realized the spec race was a nonstarter in the mobile phone world. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR “By game creators, for game creators. It is a powerful and accessible system,” Cerny said on stage, suggesting that this time around there was a strong emphasis on ease of development, hence the use of a standard x86 PC CPU. The GPU is designed for use with “practical tasks,” he said, with the overall goal of making development a painless experience.

Yet they can help refine and focus the hunt for the plane and for a solution to the deepening mystery of its March 8 disappearance. Bayesian statisticians are particularly helpful in a search operation. Their methods allow hunters to update their estimates of the probability of finding their target in any latitude-longitude combination — or even in three dimensions, accounting for depth in the water. Bayesians helped hunt U-boats in World War II, a U.S. submarine in the 1960s and an Air France jet in 2011. There’s a fourth dimension to the current search: the cause of the disappearance. New developments, such as information about how the plane’s communication systems were shut off, have lowered the probability that the plane disappeared because of an accident and increased the likelihood of deliberate diversion. Which explanation is the current leader, in turn, affects the probability of finding the plane at any given location: A deliberate act has made spots farther from the takeoff point of Kuala Lumpur more likely. Bayesian inference formalizes what will seem, to many unfamiliar with it, like common sense. Its founding principle is that most new situations can be assessed and assigned probabilities: How likely is this restaurant to be good? How likely is this cough to be a cold? How likely is Duke to win the NCAA title? Our first estimate of these probabilities may be no better than an educated guess. For example, we know that 60 percent of our restaurant meals in town have been good, or that Duke has won titles in four of the last 25 seasons (16 percent). Then we start layering new information. The restaurant is full. Now we can feel more confident in our choice: All of our good meals in town have been in full restaurants, but just half of our bad meals have been. What is the chance of a good meal, given that a restaurant is full? It’s 75 percent, based on this new information, since 75 percent of meals in full restaurants have been good. Before ordering, we check our favorite food-review website and see that the place has four and a half stars out of five. Every meal we’ve eaten at restaurants rated that highly has been good, but just half of our meals at restaurants with lower ratings have been. So we update our probability again, accounting for any overlap between full restaurants and highly rated ones — until we eat, when probability", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports. That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes.

Brown called Shannon Egeland's insurance scheme and concocted shooting, which led to the amputation of his left leg, \"an unthinkable kind of situation,\" and tacked on three years and 10 months to his 10-year sentence for mortgage fraud. Egeland, who stood on a prosthetic leg before the judge in U.S. District Court in Portland, said he's spent time reflecting the past 3 1/2 years he's been in custody, and has realized he's in need of mental health counseling and treatment. He's now taking three mental health-related medications. Egeland's son, Rylan, shot him in the lower legs with a 20-gauge shotgun along a roadside in Caldwell, Idaho, hoping to delay his prison sentence and benefit from a bogus disability insurance policy that he had applied for seven days earlier. The son left the scene, and Egeland called 911 and claimed he was a victim of assault when he stopped to help a pregnant motorist. He told authorities he was suddenly hit in the head and shot along the side of the road. Egeland previously had pleaded guilty to fraud charges for his role in the Desert Sun housing scandal that rocked Central Oregon in 2009. He was a co-owner of Desert Sun, which raised millions from local banks through a series of phony business plans and falsified loan applications. On Wednesday, prosecutors sought a five-year sentence for the insurance scam while Egeland's lawyer urged a two-year sentence to be served consecutive to the 10-year sentence he's already serving. Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Bradford described Egeland as a \"menace to society,\" who has been on a crime spree since 2004. Egeland came up with the trumped-up shooting plan to delay his prison sentence in the mortgage fraud case and benefit from fraudulently obtained disability insurance. Bradford called Egeland a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist,\" motivated by greed who recklessly manipulated his son. The psychological and emotional destruction Egeland caused his son is unimaginable, Bradford wrote in the memo. Egeland had his teenage son obtain a 20-gauge shotgun, while Egeland got the ammunition and directed his son to shoot him in the legs on July", "answers": ["A white-collar crook is facing extra prison time for having his son shoot him in the legs with a 20-gauge shotgun, the BBC reports. Shannon Egeland, 43, was already facing 10 years for taking part in a vast mortgage-fraud scheme when he had his 17-year-old son shoot him by a road in Caldwell, Idaho, in an attempt to avoid prison. \"The psychological and emotional destruction defendant caused this minor child is unimaginable,\" US attorney Scott Bradford wrote in a sentencing memo. Back in 2009, Egeland was co-owner of an Oregon development company that defrauded banks out of $20 million in loans that he and a partner used to fund a lavish lifestyle. Facing prison, Egeland took out disability insurance and had his son aim for his legs. Egeland told police he'd been attacked after stopping to assist a pregnant driver, but investigators got suspicious when his pricey BMW, his wallet, and his cellphone weren't taken, the Idaho Statesman reports. Then they learned about his recent insurance, and the whole thing unravelled. Now Egeland is facing an extra 3 years and 10 months for his roadside scheme and had his leg amputated from the shotgun blast. Bradford called him a \"self-absorbed, opportunistic narcissist,\" the Oregonian reports, but Egeland—who is now on three medications for mental health—has cast his own judgment. \"What bothers me the most is my son—the pain is on him,'' he says. \"If I could take it all back, I would, but I can't. That will haunt me the rest of my life.''"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1541}

{"pred": "    Robin Williams, who died unexpectedly today at 63, was hugely admired among his own generation -- the genuine affection in the room, say, when he won his \"Good Will Hunting\" Oscar speaks to just how well-liked he was in Hollywood. And yet unlike many of his contemporaries, Williams had a particular impact on the slice of the population now in our mid-to-late 20s and early 30s. Through the 1990s, Williams, an established film star, shifted into a new gear in his career; he generously and humbly took on entertainment for kids. Williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns, but for people my age, Williams was our childhood. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Williams' filmography in the 1980s and early 1990s is full of prestige projects (\"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"Awakenings,\" \"Dead Poets Society\"), but something shifted with \"Hook\"; the movie about Peter Pan rediscovering the joy of Neverland had the same effect, perhaps, on Williams, who'd always been wacky and loose on-screen but was suddenly acting like he'd never grown up. It took a fairly humble A-lister to play a supporting role in an animated film at a time when voice acting was an anonymous profession, and a fairly brave comic known for working blue to abandon anything that wasn't safe for young children. And yet Williams' performance as the Genie in \"Aladdin\" was straightforwardly a triumph, lending one of Disney's grimmer stories its imaginative expansiveness. Without Williams, it's impossible to imagine \"Aladdin\" becoming the VHS classic it was through the 1990s; people in my age bracket, even those who may not be able to quote chapter and verse, can easily call to mind the sense of fun and comfort Williams' voice conjured. He was generous enough to erase his recognizable face and body entirely, and yet as a blue drawing was more vivid and lifelike than the vast majority of TV characters. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Again and again, Williams went to extremes in his desire to please. In \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" simply one of the best family films ever made, the actor buried his face under makeup and his body in a fat suit in order to pull off physical comedy that felt, for kids, somehow illicit. We weren't supposed to be seeing something so strangely charged, even if the moral (about parental love) was brought home safely.", "answers": ["After Robin Williams' sudden death, the tributes are rolling in, with many recalling a comic genius grappling with private challenges.

Much of it will be some of the same adjectives used when any great performer dies—especially before their time. But in Williams' case, most of it will be true.\" Early in his career, \"it was clear that Mr. Williams was one of the most explosively, exhaustingly, prodigiously verbal comedians who ever lived,\" AO Scott writes in the New York Times. And beyond that, \"his essential persona as an entertainer combined neediness and generosity, intelligence and kindness, in ways that were charming and often unexpectedly moving.\" Williams may have gotten his start long before Aladdin, but he gave a \"generous and humble\" gift to the millennial generation, writes Daniel D'Addario at Salon. \"Williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns, but for people my age, Williams was our childhood,\" from Mrs. Doubtfire to Jumanji to Flubber. In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan recalls a moment when, facing an onslaught of photographers, Williams asked him—in the voice of a fly from a 1950s sci-fi flick—to \"help me, Ken.

Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

{"pred": "    The news is about the deaths of two pharmaceutical billionaires, Barry Sherman and his wife, Honey Sherman. The couple was found dead in their North York home on Friday. Police have deemed the deaths \"suspicious\" and have taken over the investigation. Some news outlets are quoting police sources, saying the case is being investigated as a murder-suicide. The family has released a statement saying they are shocked and think it's irresponsible that police sources have reportedly advised the media of a theory which neither their family, their friends nor their colleagues believe to be true. The couple had listed their home for sale shortly before they died. Friends, employees and well-wishers have been dropping off flowers in honour of the Shermans. The Shermans were known for their philanthropy and dedication to their family and community. They were also known for their business success and for creating hundreds of jobs in Toronto. The Shermans' deaths have been a shock to the city and the business community. The investigation is ongoing and the cause of death has not yet been determined.

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

{"pred": "    The final stage of the vote, the first since Mubarak was ousted in February, covers nine provinces including the North and South Sinai governorates. Islamist groups are expected to consolidate the gains they made in earlier rounds, in which the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party took the lead ahead of the more conservative Nour party, which represents Salafi Muslims. The third phase will not change much the nature of the upcoming parliament, as it will likely underline the control of Islamists. The election and Mubarak's trial, which resumed last week after a two-month hiatus, take place amid growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they won't cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June. It's unclear what powers the elected assembly, due to hold its first session on Jan. 23, will have and how a new government will be formed. Clashes in Cairo last month between security forces and demonstrators calling for an earlier end to military rule left at least 17 people dead. Protesters are preparing to take to the streets on Jan. 25 to mark the anniversary of the mass rallies that drove Mubarak from power. Economic growth has slowed as the unrest deters tourists and investors. Foreign-currency reserves declined by 44 percent to $20.2 billion in the first 11 months of 2011. The benchmark EGX 30 stock index (EGX) lost 49 percent last year, making it the third-worst performer among world markets tracked by Bloomberg. About 14 million voters are eligible to vote in this round, and 150 parliamentary seats are up for grabs. In Minya, one of the provinces where balloting is being held today, Mina Magdy, a Christian, said gains by Islamists in previous rounds encouraged him to vote for the secular Egyptian Bloc alliance. The court trying Mubarak adjourned until tomorrow, state television reported. It showed Mubarak carried on a gurney to and from the makeshift courtroom in a police academy. Prosecutor Moustafa Soliman told the court Mubarak was a \"tyrant\" who sought to install his son, Gamal, in his place, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. His trial is a reminder to future rulers that they will be held accountable for breaking the law, the prosecutor said. Mubarak allowed former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli to \"practice oppression and violence against Egyptians so he could remain in office,\" Soliman said, according to MENA.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
