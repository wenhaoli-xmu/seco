{"pred": "        Grad F thought that intermediate categories might be useful for noise estimation and other tasks. However, they would need to be realistic and not manual segmenters. The type of VAD that will be used in the final evaluation is still unknown. Grad F also mentioned that smoothing the SNR estimate can help improve the performance of spectral subtraction. The current estimate of clean speech is smoothed to derive the Wiener filter, and a small time constant is used to update it quickly. More smoothing seems to be helpful, but the results are still comparable to the baseline. Grad F is trying different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum, clean speech, and SNR. Putting a floor on the SNR can help reduce variance in the low-energy regions. The current baseline system does not use LDA filtering or on-line normalization. Grad F is also testing Carlos' filters to see if they help or degrade performance. The filter has a Mexican hat structure and enhances the onset and offset of speech. It seems to be helpful, but it doesn't create a lot of negative values in the cubic root. Grad F will continue to work on this and ask Carlos for more information. The subspace work was not completed last week due to bug fixing and other tasks. Grad F is still working on it and hopes to have some results soon. The VTS work is still ongoing, and the current plan is to apply it in the cepstral domain. However, the codebook is dependent on the level of the speech signal, so it may not be a good model of speech. Normalizing the cepstra and removing the median can help address this issue. The current plan is to estimate the noise with the first frames and apply the VAD before on-line normalization. Grad F is still working on this and hopes to have results soon. The pros and cons of different methods will be considered soon, and potential combinations will be explored. The characteristics of each method will be analyzed to determine what should be combined.
