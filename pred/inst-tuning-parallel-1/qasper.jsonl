{"pred": "Yes, their NER model learns NER from both text and images. The model takes as input a sequence of tokens, each of which comprises a word token, a character sequence, and an image, in their respective representation. The model then uses a Bi-LSTM and CRF hybrid model to produce a label for each token. The modality attention module learns a unified representation space for multiple available modalities (words, characters, images, etc.), and produces a single vector representation with aggregated knowledge among multiple modalities, based on their weighted importance.
