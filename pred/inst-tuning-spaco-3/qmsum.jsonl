So, we wanted to review it because it's still relatively new. They've only been up and running about two or three years. He brought out some positives—things that we, I think, are doing well. I think they found that the voluntary partnership approach was quite effective. He did suggest that, actually, what they need to be producing is much shorter, sharper, focused reports. There was a suggestion of a lack of transparency, in terms of reporting from those regional skills partnerships, and that's obviously something now that we've undertaken to review. And there, I think, is an understanding that what we need to do now is to put in place those changes. But, on the whole, what we've done is to reinforce our commitment to the regional skills partnerships, and in particular now, through allocating £10 million to further education colleges to respond directly to the wishes and the desires of the regional skills partnerships, you can see actually the status of the regional skills partnerships has just grown significantly. Because now there is an outcome as a result of their recommendations. So, you've seen quite a dramatic shift, I think, in the respect for regional skills partnerships over the past year.

They suggested focusing on finding better training targets and labeling methods to reduce language and noise dependencies.

However, they noted that the neural network approach may not be robust to different noise conditions. They also discussed the possibility of connecting the neural network to the OGI system and exploring different ways of combining the neural network features with the HTK features. Overall, they were optimistic about the potential of the neural network approach but recognized that there were still many open questions and areas for further exploration. \n\nQuery: What were the main issues with the current system?\nAnswer: The main issues with the current system were the language and noise dependencies of the training targets and the lack of robustness to different noise conditions. The training targets were based on phonetic targets, which may not be the best choice for reducing language dependencies. The noise dependencies were also a concern, as the current system was not trained on a wide range of noise conditions. Additionally, the current system was not robust to different noise conditions, which may limit its performance in real-world applications. \n\nQuery: What were the future work plans for the project?\nAnswer: The future work plans for the project included connecting the neural network to the OGI system, exploring different ways of combining the neural network features with the HTK features, and working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the HTK diagram. The goal was to improve the performance of the system and make it more robust to different noise conditions.
